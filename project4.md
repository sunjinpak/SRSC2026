# Project 4: Leader Workaholism and Reproductive Health

**Team**: Quin & Michelle

**Title**: The impact of leader workaholism on female working students' reproductive health

---

## Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Prediction | Result |
|------------|------------|--------|
| H1 | Leader workaholism (cognitive) → After-hours ICT use (+) | **Supported** (*b* = 0.31, *p* < .05) |
| H2 | After-hours ICT use → Heavy menstrual bleeding (+) | **Supported** (*b* = 0.16, *p* < .05) |

## Sample

- **N** = 86 female working students
- Average age: 24.36 years
- 50.0% Latinx
- Average work hours: 33.73 hours/week
- Average credit hours: 14.17

## Key Variables

| Variable | Description | Items | Scale |
|----------|-------------|-------|-------|
| MWS_5-8 | Leader Workaholism - Cognitive | 4 items | 1-5 Likert |
| ICT frequency | After-hours ICT use | 1 item | 1-5 Frequency |
| Q153 | Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) | 1 item | 1-5 Severity |
| Q154 | Menstrual pain severity (dysmenorrhea) | 1 item | 1-5 Severity |

### Leader Workaholism Scale - Cognitive Subscale (MWS_5-8)

Scale: 1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree

| Variable | Item |
|----------|------|
| MWS_5 | It feels like my supervisor cannot stop themself from thinking about working |
| MWS_6 | In general, it seems that my supervisor spends their free time thinking about work |
| MWS_7 | It seems that at any given time, the majority of my supervisor's thoughts are work related |
| MWS_8 | It seems that it is difficult for my supervisor to stop thinking about work when they stop working |

### Reproductive Health Measures

**Q153 - Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Menorrhagia)**

Rate the extent to which you experience heavy menstrual bleeding

Scale: 1 = Not at all, 2 = Slightly, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Very, 5 = Extremely

**Q154 - Menstrual Pain Severity (Dysmenorrhea)**

Rate the intensity of menstrual pain

Scale: 1 = No pain, 2 = Mild pain, 3 = Moderate pain, 4 = Strong pain, 5 = Severe pain

### ICT Demands

**ICT frequency**: How often you used work-related ICTs outside formal work hours in the past week

Scale: 1 = Never, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = About half the time, 4 = Most of the time, 5 = Almost always
