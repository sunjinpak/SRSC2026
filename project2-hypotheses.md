**Title**: The impact of leader workaholism on working students' emotional exhaustion and school withdrawal

**Team**: Jesus & Eric

## Model

```
Leader Workaholism (Cognitive) → ICT → Emotional Exhaustion → School Withdrawal
```

## Hypotheses

**H1**: Leader workaholism (cognitive) is positively related to employees' after-hours ICT use.

**H2**: After-hours ICT use is positively related to emotional exhaustion.

**H3**: Emotional exhaustion is positively related to school psychological withdrawal.

**H4**: After-hours ICT use mediates the relationship between leader workaholism (cognitive) and emotional exhaustion.

**H5**: Emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between after-hours ICT use and school psychological withdrawal.

**H6**: Leader workaholism (cognitive) has an indirect effect on school psychological withdrawal through the serial mediation of after-hours ICT use and emotional exhaustion.

## Analysis Plan

1. Descriptive statistics and correlations
2. Reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha for multi-item scales)
3. Direct effects (H1, H2, H3)
4. Mediation analysis using PROCESS macro or path analysis (H4, H5)
5. Serial mediation (H6)
