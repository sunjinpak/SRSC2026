## Transcript
 
[Participant #29]: Sure, I work as a Admin coordinator assistant with music theater and art department.So basically, my job is to program events through 25 live also scheduling, and any of the just administrative duties that's required of me for those departments.
 
S: Okay? So in order to have that role, is playing instrument is required.
 
[Participant #29]: Not for the music and theater. No, I'm more on the art side. I do illustration and and art. So that's more my forte. But I love music and theater. It's just I lucked out, and was able just to get a position within its arts and humanities, so they were able to draw me in in both of those departments.
S: I play. I play piano, and I oh, good! Your wife plays musical instrument. 
 
[Participant #29]: Yeah. Violin,
 
S: So I just curious as some.
 
[Participant #29]: Yeah, we just got a piano for our house, so it's still collecting dust, but it's been used a few times where she's getting. She's she's cracking it open so it's good.
 
S: Okay. I bought 2 used piano for my children.
I think just they are just playing while they just run around our house. I think it's good that we have more than one piano in our house.
 
[Participant #29]: I think that's a good idea. Not make it daunting like. It's a bad thing you want to make it like a like a play toy kind of. So it's good. Yeah.
 
S: For your job, does that require a physical presence? Can you work remotely.
 
[Participant #29]: Occasionally I have to request it through the Dean's office to work remotely, but primarily it's in office.
 
S: So when the air quality is not good, or if it is really hot weather.
Do you feel comfortable to ask your Dean, that you want to work at your home.
 
[Participant #29]: I feel comfortable asking them, but it's something that I would assume is not acceptable, I guess, in the terms that it's just like it's not part of my job function to work from home, and we have our facility there. So since we're indoors primarily most of the day, I think. They would just rather have me be in office for our students, because I am student facing.
 
S: Okay, I think that's great. Can you walk us through a typical day for you, including your working hours and after work hours.
 
[Participant #29]: Sure so typically when it's not summer 8 to 5. And so I began in music and theater. So it's a lot of the admin just processing like payments, forms doing events. So music and theaters more heavy with our events. And you know it's a weekly thing I also am required to work after hours. So if there's an event I'm doing the box office. So ticket sales.
 
[Participant #29]: I also work with the 60 Plus Club. They volunteer to help us with tickets, so I coordinate with them to get them up and going to help our patrons so primarily. That's what I'm doing in music and theater with the art department. I work music and theater up until lunch, so noon, and then at one o'clock I'll go to Art Department, and then from there I will help with their admin duties, with processing payment forms, travel, claims, scheduling. It's not as heavy of a load as music and theater, but I am outdoors quite a bit more with music and theater, because, you know, sometimes we'll put up posters, or I'm running to the print shop to pick up orders.
and then the the art department. If they have me go outside, it's just to go get like our mail, because they've moved our mail office from the Hob building all the way to the media art center. So it's kind of a it's kind of a hall to get over there, so I am outdoors quite a bit.
  
S: Are there any occasion that you need to coordinate with the outdoor concert or exhibition.
 
[Participant #29]: No, we haven't had an outdoor concert exhibitions. It's usually in the dory theater is where we have most of our events.
 
S: Okay, after your work. Do you have chance to walk outside.
 
[Participant #29]: I do. Yeah. Occasionally I'll I will walk outside. Also, during work hours. If I have the opportunity, on a break I'll walk outside.
 
S: How long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley? So I mean, current county.
 
[Participant #29]: Since 2,000 so 25 years.
 
S: Wow! It's a long our time. What brought you here?
 
[Participant #29]: State farm insurance. My mom worked for State Farm in Costa Mesa, where I'm from, and they relocated from Costa Mesa to Bakersfield to start an Operations Center. So they brought the organization to Kern County in Bakersfield. and then from that point, you know, I was down in Orange County and the Inland Empire still for a little bit, and then I eventually moved on up to go to school and then find work because the work I was doing down in Orange County was just more like factory work, and I wasn't happy with it.
 
S: Hmm, okay. So you live to region Orange County and Inland Empire and Bakersfield. So.
 
[Participant #29]: Correct. Yeah, I was born in the City of Orange. I grew up in Tustin that area. It's kind of by Santa Ana. So from.
Since I was born to 10th grade, and then from 10th grade I moved to Lake Elsador. So, Corona, and then from 10th grade to probably you know, Junior college. So I was about I don't know. 19 to 20 I was out there and then from 20, 21, 23, I moved up to Bakersfield.
 
S: Ok. I know, Corona, because my sister-in-law lived there.
 
[Participant #29]: Okay. Cool.
 
S: I visited their family multiple times, and so I'm quite familiar with it. So could you compare the air quality between 3rd region.
 
[Participant #29]: The 3 Regions will, with Orange County. It's beach weather, so it's overcast. In the morning we have a breeze. I felt I could breathe the best there. And since you know, since I was a little kid, maybe I may have been more adapted to that climate, and then moving to the Inland Empire. It was quite a bit more Santa Ana Winds and Corona and Lake Elsamore compared to the beach. So you know we get a lot of wind blowing through there. They had issues with valley fever as well. I had a friend's mother pass away who lived out there, so it was just it was an issue. So, but the air was a lot crisper in the Inland Empire than it is here.
I could tell a big difference with that it seemed cleaner and then moving to Bakersfield. Since we're in the valley, a lot of the particles settle here in the valley, so I developed quite a few respiratory issues moving up here.
 
S: So your body reacted when you move from, you know LA To Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #29]: Absolutely.
 
S: But you lived here for more than 20 years. So has your perspective on air quality issues changed during those 20 years. More than 20 years.
 
[Participant #29]: I would say so, just being in the environment, seeing how the current county area, you know, with, we live around oil refineries here, so when they dump their emissions into the air, you can smell it. In the morning when I 1st moved here it was the the air seemed a lot more brown or yellow in the in the sky, and I know they've changed things since I've moved up here. They've added, you know, chemicals to either dissipate those or just change the color. But I know they're still there.
 
S: How about have you talked with your mother? That about the air quality? So.
 
[Participant #29]: Yeah, I have. She feels the same way she she hasn't developed a cough like I have. But yeah, since I've moved up here, I've I've been tested for valley fever, probably 2 or 3 times. They haven't found anything, but it's a substantial, like a chronic cough that I've developed.
Oh, and I have an inhaler, too, that I've been prescribed so.
 
S: Okay, so were there any critical experiences or moment that you thought that the air quality in Bakersfield is bad.
 
[Participant #29]: Quite a few times, I mean, any time you like. Yesterday we were we went to Los Angeles, and the air quality is bad there. But when you go up the grapevine it's like coming out of the smog cloud, and you can tell right around like Lebeck, that area you can see like you break through the smog. So anytime you're going down the grapevine right where the the large hill is you? You can see you're right going right into the smog.
 
S: Hmm, yeah, I commute from Santa Clarita.
So I always go through that kind of wall of the dust from grapevine. Yeah. So I totally understand. So in what ways do the air quality in Bakersfield affect your daily activities.
 
[Participant #29]: Well, I think a lot of times I just have to be cautious when the air is bad, to go outside and exercise anytime, you know, I'm having, you know, chest issues, which is pretty frequently. I need to really make sure that I'm not overdoing it. It's it's almost like an asthma, so I don't want to push myself, and especially with the heat on top of it. I feel like you can put yourself in a pretty bad situation pretty quick, if you're, you know, exerting yourself more than you need to.
 
S: Have you noticed that the also others around you are impacted by the air quality.
 
[Participant #29]: Somewhat not like I am, I mean. I know some folks who have transplanted themselves from Orange County up here, and to a degree. I guess they could have maybe some of the same symptoms as as I have, but I'm not close enough with them to know their medical history. Just people that I've worked with at State Farm that I know live down in Orange County that have moved up here.
Most people I know that I've met from Bakersfield are actually born and raised in Bakersfield, and it seems like it's kind of like I mentioned earlier. This is like they've adapted, you know, it's almost like they've they've adapted to their environment. It's like an evolutionary type of thing.
 
S: I felt that, too, because I moved to Bakersfield in 2022, and I decided to move to Santa Clarita when I detected my 3 month old my 3rd baby became have symptoms of asthma. Now she's good, but at the time it was really stressful for us.
Because my new job impacted my children. So I just want, yeah. So just wonder how your mother felt about your symptom, because she had to move to Bakersfield because of her job. Do you detect it?
 
[Participant #29]: Yeah, my mom is definitely a mom. So she's she's very aware of it. And she's concerned. So you know, she's always on me about like, you know. If you need to use your inhaler, then use it. Get checkups. Don't wait. So you know, thankfully, I have a good mom. So she's, you know. She looks out for me.
 
S: Okay? And also as a new people, who just moved to Bakerfield. In my case, when I talk about the air quality with the people around me. They feel like they're quite a just as you said
Have you ever, you know, felt like you are lonely because you're the one that feel sensitive to air quality in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #29]: Actually, that's yeah. I do, actually, because, I've had to. kind of feel like I've had to explain my cough to people occasionally at work. It's like, you know. Forgive me that I'm I'm popping. Excuse me, have someone at the door real quick. We have a plumber. Just give me one quick second.
No, you're fine, all right. Thank you so much. So yeah, with feeling lonely. Just. It's almost a little embarrassing sometimes, like. If I have a coughing fit at work or around people, it's
It's just because I know me as a person. I'm you know, a dude, and I want to be strong, and I don't want to like come off as like, oh, I'm like sickly or weak, and it's just it. It's kind of it bugs me sometimes.
 
S: I felt that the same way, and as a new employee I felt like I think I felt some pressure that I need to want to look like a good, you know colleague, and and I just wanted to show that I I'm the one that I'm I will work in this campus that for the Cs. To be for a long time. But when I complain about the air quality they will.
you know, quickly think that I want to go out of this organization, not because of this bad environment, but about this bad organizational culture. But do you feel like those kind of pressure pressure like me?
 
[Participant #29]: Maybe around certain people that don't agree with data or look at facts, or are just cognizant about science. You know, climate change and those types of things. You know, I've run into quite a few people on campus, though even they work on a university. They're very narrow minded in those issues. So it's interesting.
 
S: Okay, when we interview some people, employees are guided to not to worry when the temperature is beyond certain, you know, temperature.
But they're working. It's not depend on the air quality itself, only on temperature.
So have you ever thought about you need to change your work schedule or workloads, not because of the temperature, but because of the air quality.
 
[Participant #29]: It's on my radar, especially with how my health is being impacted. And I I know it's directly correlates with the air quality. So on days that it is just real muggy here. There's no air moving. It's just we're just sitting in a cloud of either dust or pollutants. I would say, if it's
if we can continue going down this road where we're having more days that are unhealthy like the 8 the Api Index. Or I think that's what it is. The quality index at the Aqi. Excuse me, the Aqi Index, you know. Those are more red flag days, and I'm seeing a direct impact of those days affect my breathing. Then I would definitely consider taking it up with the Dean's office to see if maybe I can work from home, or just maybe limit my going outdoors to run errands, because I am outside quite a bit, you know, kind of fetching things around campus.
 
S: your work requires you to work outside quite frequently when I hear your experiences. But have you ever tried to use your mask when when there's a bad air quality.
 
[Participant #29]: You know I have. During Covid I tried it out, and the best way I can explain it, and it's it's 1 of those, you know. Oh, boohoo! Kind of things, but I like breathing through my nose. I can't breathe through my mouth, and especially since I wear glasses, the mask and breathing through my mouth, fogs up my glasses. So it's 1 of those I'd rather just be comfortable and be able to breathe than fight with the mask.
 
S: Okay, I totally understand you. So how comfortable are people in your workplace with discussing air quality issue.
 
[Participant #29]: To a degree, I think. there are people I can confide with that are on the same page with a lot of the the data that we're seeing with our air quality, but not everybody. There's some folks I mean. I just know that any type of conversation like that be a political or just environmental opens up a bag of, you know. It's just a lot of nonsense. I don't need to hear from them.
 
S: Okay, so I think there are moments that you have detected that your colleagues don't want to talk about those kind of air quality concerns, because it will make you more comfortable because they will relate with the political issue or other.
 
[Participant #29]: Exactly. Her agenda. The politics. Yeah, exactly.
 
S: So when you feel like that, can you, you know, reveal your personal issue more with them? Or do you feel.
 
[Participant #29]: Yeah, just with some of them, I mean with, specifically, I feel at my previous job with State Farm. It was more of like a organization or corporate environment. And you know.
We were able to communicate to a degree, it was more focused on our work. So any interactions that I had with my teammates was either out in the break area or in passing. Cscb is more. We're more immersed with people, you know, because we we deal with students coming in, and we have faculty that are sitting next to a desk. So it's it's more like a air traffic controllers, people always coming and going. So I've just learned to find the people that I'm I see eye to eye with, and just be conservative or cautious with the people that I know, who like to kind of twist topics to fit their narrative. So.
 
S: Okay, I think that's a really important topic. I have never detected from other, you know interviewing because. I haven't thought about that the the discussing about the error quality issue will automatically transfer people to discuss about the political issue.
So the air quality issue or concerns is a daily challenges for you specifically, and also me, and also many group of people.
But if you cannot discuss about that, I think it will be really difficult to talk about the other issue. So when you find that there's a folks who could talk about the daily challenges like air quality issue, do you feel more comfortable, revealing your challenges or your personal concerns with them.
 
[Participant #29]: I would say so. Yeah, I mean, I have friends that are coworkers that you know, we can discuss certain things, and it's not. It doesn't go anywhere else than you know. Just the facts of like, Hey, the air is really bad today. You know, we need to really consider, you know, our energy sources, or you know, what our taxpayer dollars are doing for current county, because there's a lot of issues. You know, it's it is a very blue collar town, and I know a lot of people that are in this town have someone who works in the oil fields or is directly connected with gas. So I think that's where a lot of the politics come from of anytime. You bring up air quality. It's just like, well, you know I have a family member that works in the oil field, and they they'll tell. They tell me that it's all bogus, so I have to believe them too, you know.
 
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: I have one follow up question. I'm sorry if this is an uncomfortable question, and feel free to not, feel free not to answer. But when you have chatted casually about the air quality issue with your cord, or did it feel like most of them share similar political views or perspective as you. When you receive some. I will say, like more positive when you had a more positive conversation about the air quality issues.
 
[Participant #29]: You know, since we're on a campus, I would say, you know, more folks are align themselves with data and facts. There's just a very small majority of people, and it's very few people that I've run into on campus that are surprisingly
forthcoming with being ignorant on it. And that's my bias, too. I mean, we could be wrong, too. But it's just that's my assumption that they don't want to listen to science or facts. They have their own ideologies with like, I said. Family members are telling them because they work in the oil industry, or you know, they have somebody they listen to and their their media world that is telling them otherwise. So it's it's interesting, I would say, as a university, we're functioning as a university. Most folks there are, we're able to go to them, and we can discuss things openly and have a have a dialogue about it. Because, you know, I think that's a problem with just everywhere in California we get to a point where we speak about it, and then the subject either changes into politics or changes somewhere else, and as far as Cscb. Is concerned, I would love to see an open forum on our climate here. I know we had something called Blue Zones. There was a I guess. a lecture or an a symposium on blue blue zones. And they did an okay job. But it just seemed very temporary. They didn't seem like a long term solution. It was just basically. Well, you know, you have all these other areas in the world that they live longer because the air is better, or the food quality is better. We would love that for current county, too, but there's never any follow up, and there's never. you know no one ever piggybacks on that. It's just. It seems like it's up to one person to fix everything all the time.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thank you. Insightful.
 
S: So oftentimes we cannot share our personal health challenges like asthma, or even we could not share. You know our children's challenges to the people. because it's kind of indicates that that's 1 of the vulnerable. You know aspects of my life.
So when you felt like, you know, the Your. There are colleagues think that you know the air quality issue? Is not that serious? And they just involve that concerns with the political dialogue. How do you feel in that moment?
 
[Participant #29]: Just uneasy and just uncertain, really just almost frustration, that I try to see their point of view. I really do, because I know that everybody has. There's, you know, that is true, and every and everything that people say you can find truth in even the most wildest statements sometimes. And I. They do have an experience that I don't. and especially, you know, interacting with people who've either been raised on a farm here or grown up around agriculture, you know. It takes it takes knowledge to maintain a farmland. So I try to listen to. Well, you know they have this perspective on it. They may have some insight that I don't. But, you know, being a college graduate and still going to, I'm in a master's program, and there's certain things that I'm still like. it's just like how you guys are conducting a research for data. I mean, that's the numbers don't lie, you know. So you know what I mean.
 
S: Yeah. So in terms of the experiences that you have from your symptom, from the air quality, I I believe that you are more knowledgeable than the people who think that the air quality is not the issue. So when you met with them, do you have? Do you try to persuade them by sharing your own symptom with them.
 
[Participant #29]: I try not to. To tell you the truth, like there's been some issues with work history along the way, sharing anything too personal, with like health concerns, because I found that, you know, if you don't have a coworker that has you in your their best interest.
they just end up weaponizing that and using it against you. It's just like, Oh, well, they're just making an excuse, or they're out today because of this, or they just make a lot of assumptions. So I try to be conservative with what I tell people about my health concerns or just limit it to my my leadership. So my supervisors or the Dean's office, I can let them know. But a coworker I wouldn't let them know.
 
S: I think that's a great point, because sharing our vulnerability sometimes affect positive outcome. So they can, you know, understand? My, you know, condition so they can be more flexible on my work demands or schedule. But sometime, as you said, some people might weaponize my vulnerability so that that could make my, you know, negative career outcome as well.
 
[Participant #29]: Exactly just a lot of gossip. Yup.
 
S: Okay, in that moment you might feel quite isolated because you cannot share your own concerns.
 
[Participant #29]: Since this is specific to like my coughing and chronic cough. Yeah, it's it's crossed my mind quite a few times of of like, you know I'm having a coughing fit. I wonder if they assume that I have something worse than what it is, you know, or you know. you know, growing up in Orange County. There was a big tuberculosis outbreak, and there was a lot of stigma on a lot of communities for having tuberculosis, and it was.
 It was rather, kind of heartbreaking the way people were treated for coughing, growing up, and I'm sure you know I'm not. I just want to be transparent. It was a lot of Asian communities that I went to school with in Orange County, and a lot of people pointed the finger at them, for the reason that, like there was so many tuberculosis outbreak. And you know that's that's not true, or the case is just, you know. unfortunate, you know.
 
S: Yeah, I remember that I lived in Pittsburgh during a pandemic, and I felt like people are avoiding me when I'm in Trader Joe. because I'm Asian, and they might think that I'm a Chinese, and that's a white town and they, I felt like they're they have less knowledgeable on the Asian ethnic group. So I totally understand that.
 
[Participant #29]: Yeah, thank you for understanding. Yeah, it's just it was. It's quite a quite a sensitive topic. And yeah, I think it still exists with just here in California. Sadly, yeah, people have that that mindset.
 
S: I think people have those kind of sere typing or bias because they don't.
They are not knowledgeable for the folks who are, you know, facing those daily error quality issue. So the folks who are coughing and sneezing or nosing every day. It's their daily issue. And that is because of the air quality issue. But the folks who don't have that symptom and who don't have the family members who are having those challenges they cannot understand, at least, unless they have a friend who are suffering from those concerns.
 
[Participant #29]: Exactly. I know. Yeah, you don't know until you know. I mean, I have someone who, personally, I know that passed away from Covid, and you know a lot of people do, too. But there's also quite a few people that don't have anybody they were directly impacted for. And I feel like that's that's kind of the
What seals the deal until you know somebody that's affected to it, or if, unless you're directly affected by it, it doesn't matter to. For some reason it doesn't matter to them.
 
S: So when I, when we interview people like 30% of the people they volunteer for this interview because they said, they are interested in this air quality issue, but still they don't have much knowledge on how people are concerned with the air quality. and they are kept having, you know, the inhaler, but they feel like they are not concerned with the air quality issue.
For me. It's a big, big thing. But Taking Inhaler is quite popular in this region. I think.
 
[Participant #29]: It is. And I've been referred actually out of town. So how I've mentioned earlier I was tested for valley fever multiple times here they've never found fungus or spores in my chest, but yet there's something causing the chronic cough other than asthma, so they've, you know, prescribed me an inhaler. and they said, Well, if you want a specialist, then go outside of Kern County. So I thought that was interesting, that out of all of Kern County, with all these respiratory issues, they're still referring people out of the county to figure it out.
S: when you cannot discuss the concerns about the air quality issue or your symptoms of coughing openly with your colleague. How does that affect your confidence in your in your workplace?
 
[Participant #29]: Just being a nuisance. Really, that's that's where it gets for me, where it impacts me. Because if I do have a coughing fit, which is pretty frequently at work, you know, in the morning or in the afternoon.
you know, it's just like I don't want to like how we mentioned earlier. I just don't want to be the weak link, or somebody who's just annoying other people with their their health.
 
S: Okay, so let's shift gear regarding our current organizational efforts. You shared that our Csb are doing some campaign or symposium about the air quality issue. And I realized that our Csb begin to talk about the valley fever symptoms and you know, educating people to make make people our community members that belly fever issue is really serious thing. But regard. But in addition. what steps our csub can take to take action, to address error, code issue.
 
[Participant #29]: I think we can have training, or just an open forum of somebody, because I know we have like seminars on our Kit fox population where we're talking about, you know. Be cautious of their dens. I think there needs to be some type of implementation of kangaroo rats, or you know anything that's causing the Hanta virus on campus, because, you know, we are almost we are a national park, almost on campus, where we have a lot of different types of rodents on campus. There's a lot of storage areas that are holding different. I guess
I'm not sure if my wife mentioned the dirt issue where people from 60 plus are moving, you know, dirt without mass, you know, there's quite a few areas on campus where we could do better as far as training.
You know the whole respiratory issues about wearing masks on certain days.
If you know we have a hot weather day, maybe, you know, have an alert or an email to stay indoors. There's there could be a lot of things.
 
S: I think one of your ideas resonate me like having mask for entire day. I think that could appreciate people who feel uncomfortable about the air quality issue, and we all can. You know, experience that how it is difficult by taking mask whole day.
 
[Participant #29]: Yeah, I think I mean, if the campus is serious about it, then I think people will fall in line, especially if you know there's data being presented. It's it says it right there. And they have resources that they can look and see.
This is a trustworthy resource. I need to really consider protecting myself from particulates or particles in the air.
  
Sung Hyoun Hong: It's insightful. So the training, the mainly focus on raising awareness of air quality issues and educating them, how to how they can approach their quality issues right?
So are there any more direct organizational level? I will say the solution or practice that could be implemented as well, such as like flexible work arrangements, something like that, like what kind of effort organization can directly solve the problem of the employee rather than providing. you know, like knowledge, or any other solutions, or any other strategies to deal with.
 
[Participant #29]: That's really good.
Because I mean we, I think we're at a at a crosswords with a mentality of well. I can work from home. Why don't we just move everything online? Why do we even need the campus to even be open to the public? Or why do we even need the buildings there. So I think there may be some hesitance on a lot of work from home options. I I personally think you know, if we approach it realistically, and we have. you know, our Provost or the Deans sit down and have a real conversation about hey? These are the facts.
We can forecast certain days throughout the year that are known to be the Aqi is really heavy or high. We need to consider working from home options. I know my wife mentioned on on her interview. They burn tumbleweeds on campus, and that's atrocious. I cannot believe they allow us to work on campus when they're doing that, because you're basically sitting in a campfire in your office while they're doing that. And it just it's unfortunate.
  
S: Hmm, okay, I think we have talk we have covered most of the questions. And, [Participant #29].
we are. We are still. We need to. We are on the road to completing this. Interviews. So do you have any recommendation that we can have for our future interviewee. So what kind of questions we can have for our future interviewees.
 
[Participant #29]: I think a good one would be how our campus is working with our students. I think we need to have a relationship with how they can feel comfortable on campus, and how our staff and faculty can feel comfortable on campus. I know we promote quite a bit to our student safety, but sometimes I don't feel like it's reciprocated to the staff or faculty all the time. It's really we're we're there, too, you know, so I would like to see more of a student's perspective on. You know. What would they do if they worked on at Csub, or, you know. as a community member, you know. How? How do you want to see this community grow? What steps should would they take? Or should Csub take to provide safety for them for air quality. Because I think this topic, I really love that you guys are doing this survey because I I think it's it's gonna become front and center here pretty quick, I imagine.
 
S: Hmm, thank you very much. The reason why I start this your research is that the awareness about the error quality issue is not equal across people in Bakersfield. They are very new people in Bakersfield. They just lived in in Bakersfield for 5 or 7 years, and their perspective totally 100% different from the people who was born and raised here in Bakersfield. and also many people born and raised in Bakersfield. They are taking inhaler, but they think that the air quality is not bad because they are not having, like, you know, the heavy, severe symptoms like belly fever.
So in some way they feel like a very resilient, but in some way it's sad that they don't They don't. They don't feel like, you know. They are having severe symptom to take an action to improve the air quality. So with this interview, we will like to establish some model that we can test the causal, test the relationship between A and B or C, then we will take a survey to test that model. So this with this interview, we will find some theme or phenomenon first, st and then we will dive into conduct a survey. So if we conduct a survey, I might, you know, contact you again to recruit this respondents to take the survey, but I will reach out to you.
