C: Okay.
P5: The struggle.
C: Okay, okay.
C: so do you think experiencing air pollution with others can strengthen your sense of connectedness in your organization like.
P5: Yes, I think that I think they can straighten
P5: our sense of connection, because, for example.
P5: when coworkers or neighbors talk about dealing with poor air quality.
P5: I feel we are all in the same boots. So we are all like facing a common issue.
P5: So I feel it can actually cause a sense of connection. Yeah, correct.
C: Okay.
C: so how do you feel when others share the similar experiences related to air pollution like, what do you feel.
P5: I feel a mix of empathy, and at times frustration.
C: Yeah, because I.
P5: I'm not alone, but I don't really like it.
P5: And when I realized how widespread the issue is.
C: So do you guys, I mean, do you talk regarding this issue with your colleagues, too, like
C: like, sometimes people feel a bond right? So when, whenever there is a problem with it, we face, we talk to communities and friends, or we talk to people around you. So do you share when you share this issues with your colleagues like, how do you feel like so do you think that? They also feel a need to this to be addressed, or some people are okay. Even there is a problem with their quality. So that's what trying to figure it out.
P5: Okay, for this. Share my personal concerns. That's been.
P5: That's been a mixed experience. I just feel some colleagues. They are supportive
P5: and some share their own stories. And this actually helps to build trust.
P5: So so I know, actually shared their story. Yeah, but I don't really actually like go for them. I I only share my stories where I feel can actually share his own story with me.
P5: Yeah. So.
C: So has your organization been. So has the sense of bond affected your thoughts or feelings or actions towards your organization.
P5: Yeah, sure. Of course, there's something like opening. Yeah.
P5: bond. Well, with my organizations. Yeah, yeah.
C: So does your organization help you address this issue like, do they do something about? Okay, this is what you can do. This is what we are trying to do or does. Do they do something like that?
P5: I'm sure I'm sure of course. They actually like,
P5: provide us, with face masks,
P5: and they also give us, fully fires.
P5: we should actually use doing doing some work days. Yeah. So they are, they actually try a lot.
P5: Yeah.
C: So harvish like
C: I know you told me about this, but so have you when you share with this with your colleagues and friends. So they're also on board with what were the problems that you're facing right.
P5: Yeah.
C: Okay? So my next question is like, Have you taken any other actions to challenge or deal with the air quality issues?
P5: For this. Yes. I've tried to make some kind of complaints.
P5: To our workplace. So they can actually help us to
P5: They help us to deal with this, probably by providing materials for us that can actually like help to to reduce the health effects. Yeah, of these.
P5: strange head disease. Yeah. And also, I also advocate for this. I try to speak to people and try to know of their own complaints. Yeah, I try to know what they are actually going through with their family and their kids, and whether their kids have allergies or not. Yeah, I just try to just be supportive. Yeah.
C: And so how does those around you cope with bad air quality like do they use the air purifier kind of things, or any. Do they take any other extra measures than you that how do they cope around.
P5: Yeah, of course. Of course they do use air purifiers. Yes, they use it a lot, and they try to abide. And they also have regular medical checkups.
P5: Yeah, they go to the hospital to go for checkups to know about their yeah.
C: So. How do you think about your organization's action like? So you told me that they do help you to prevent or they do help you to overcome the air quality issues. But what do you think about your organization's actions?
P5: Okay. For my thoughts. For this. I feel they can actually do better.
P5: I feel they can. They can actually be more inclusive
P5: and try to carry us alone. Yeah.
P5: the although. I just feel like
P5: they should be more reactive. Yeah. So because there is no long term plan for this kind of air pollution. So I so I believe my company can actually do more.
P5: So they should promote more remote work options
P5: during poor air quality periods. And they should try to
P5: people energy solutions for our facilities. Yeah.
C: So how has the support from your organization changed your perspective on air quality issues?
P5: It's it has not really changed my perspective on air quality. It has not. Yeah, because where I actually appreciate the their efforts. It is not actually enough to make me. It is not enough to make me feel the like. The company is really committed to address the problem.
P5: I just feel like they are just trying to manage it rather than solving the issue itself. Yeah. So they've actually made small steps. They are just simply managing it. Yeah. So I feel they can do more.
C: I get that I get that.
C: So do you see yourself continuing to live in this area for long term?
P5: I'm quite uncertain about this.
P5: I'm not sure if I'll
P5: I'm not sure if I will stay here because I feel why, this region actually offers stability job stability and opportunities.
P5: The persistent developmental challenge, especially equality.
P5: actually makes me question if it's actually the best place for my family.
P5: Yeah. But if there are improvements, I'm actually consider staying. Yeah.
C: So is air quality. One of the major reason that you are trying not to stay here for long term.
P5: Of course. Yes, of course I get you my family's health.
P5: Yeah.
C: So, okay, now imagine that the air quality has significantly improved. How do you think? It would that would affect your life and the connection to the community.
P5: Yeah, of course.
P5: Are you with me?
P5: Hello.
C: Yes, yes, I can hear you.
P5: Hello!
C: Yes, yes, I can hear you.
P5: Can you commit?
P5: Ask the question again.
C: Okay, okay. So repeat the question.
C: okay, okay, no, no worries. So imagine the air quality has significantly improved. How would you? How do you think that would affect your life and your connection to the community?
P5: Okay. For this question. This is a very good question. If the air quality can actually improve I will feel more positive about raising my kids in the area
P5: and who spend more time outdoor as a family.
P5: Yeah. And it will also improve our quality of life. It will straighten the business, the company.
P5: and to make the environment more cleaner and elder for everybody.
C: Okay, so what potential factors can make people leave Sinoquin Valley.
P5: Okay, for this, I feel if there are persistent health concerns due to air quality
P5: and if there are actually better job opportunities outside the valley.
P5: Yeah. And if people don't feel supported by their employers. Yeah, I feel they can leave.
C: And what can help them stay
C: like? What potential factors can make people stay back in the Sanhagen Valley.
P5: Okay? I feel if people
P5: get stronger support from employers such as flexible work options or environmental advocacy. Yeah. And I feel if they can help in addressing these environmental challenges.
P5: A few people want to stay.
P5: Yeah.
C: Okay. And if there is effort.
P5: If there are affordable living costs.
P5: Yes, people will stay.
C: Okay.
C: I think, San Jose Valley is more affordable compared to other places. Right? I'm not. I'm not really sure about it.
P5: Yeah.
C: Okay. Is there anything else that you you would like to share about your experience with air quality or the community connections in Seneca valley that we haven't discussed like you. Would you like to add something more.
P5: Yeah, yes, I would like to add something.
P5: I feel equality does not affect the physical health. It also impacts mental health.
P5: So living in a place where you have to monitor the air quality can feel very stressful.
P5: Yeah.
P5: And I just believe there should be more collaboration between businesses and local governments. So they can help to create a long term solution for this issue.
P5: Yeah, because I feel it's not just about providing purifiers or moose marks.
P5: we should try to find long term
P5: for this issue. Yeah. And I. And I feel this kind of addressing equality is a collective responsibility.
P5: It's it starts from you and I, so I feel everybody should should make encouraging steps towards this
P5: cause. There's too, a long way to go, but I feel
P5: everything will get better sooner or later.
C: I understand. I understand.
C: I know it's it's it's a responsibility. That's why we are doing this study. So I hope we will be able to make some changes and shift towards what's been happening. And I that's all from my end. And by within 48 h, as being said like, you will receive a $20 Amazon gift card. I'll try to send it by today evening. My professor will be sending it so hopefully. But within 48 h it should be done.
C: Thank you so much for your.
P5: Alright, sure! Thank you.
C: Cooperation. I really appreciate taking your time and joining and taking this interview. I really appreciate and have a great day.
P5: Yeah. And you, too. Bye.
