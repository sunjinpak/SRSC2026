## Transcript
S: Okay? So let's talk about your current role and responsibilities. So can you please tell us about your current role in your job?
 
[Participant #30]: Sure. So I'm the director of Alumni Engagement at Csub. I've been on campus for 15 years. I've been in this role for 11 years and
I'm responsible for engaging. The university's more than 67,000 alumni. So our graduates and I have a team of 3, and I also work with an alumni board of directors, which is made up of alumni, both in the community, and then also some alumni professionals out of state as well, we try to represent well the different academic programs.
So we try to enlist alumni board members who represent the various colleges and academic programs. We hold events to engage alumni. We do fundraising activities. We have a mentoring program and we participate in several. You know campus collaborations. I also work with, you know, quite a few colleagues across campus as well to try and help engage alumni, get them to connect back to the university, support our students.
 
S: So college of business are doing alumni night. Every semester is that quite related to your office?
 
[Participant #30]: You know the alumni nights I don't think I've been involved in. I know there's an Mba alumni chapter that recently started. We've helped a little with that. We haven't been involved in alumni nights.
 
S: Okay, I just curious about that. So it seems like the events is held outside quite frequently, because I could see the the events in Linkedin and their picture outside of the building. So do you often time, have to participate in those events outside of the building.
 
[Participant #30]: I. You know we the events that we hold. We have an annual fundraising event called Party in the Park, and that's held on campus at Alumni Park. So that's outside. That's over on the east side of campus. And then we have an annual kind of black tie gala fundraising event called Alumni Hall of Fame, that is held off campus because there is not an adequate space on campus to hold a dinner for 300 people.
During the time that we hold it. And so, you know, unless we renovated the or, you know, reconfigured the basketball gym, the Icardo center. There's just not a good place to have that, you know, smaller mixers and things I'm involved in. Sometimes those will be on campus, but a lot of times. There are, I think, mixers that are off campus.
 
S: So it means that your work sometimes require you know. physical presence outside of your building.
As the activity is going outside.
 
[Participant #30]: Yeah, most. I mean, you know, really, all of our activities are outside of our building. For sure, our board meetings, any types of events, we have. If you mean, like my office building. Yes.
 
S: Okay. curious. So sometime we have a heavy wind. So during that day it's not easy to stand outside because of the dust everywhere. So. Were there any time you had considered to change the date of the event? Maybe it's not feasible. But have you ever thought about that because of the bad weather.
 
[Participant #30]: You know. So our alumni Hall of Fame event is in February, because it's focused around homecoming. And there's also the homecoming barbecue, which is in February, so I would say less wind. But rain has been an issue in the past, so.
We usually always hold our alumni hall of Fame dinner inside. But the homecoming barbecue is around the same time, and that's outside. And that's always yeah. There's not really another space for it. So you know, we would rent a a you know, a tent in like a rain contingency. We haven't ever rescheduled anything due to wind, to my knowledge.
 
S: Okay, I'm sorry. I just forgot to introduce my colleague Sung and Hong from Georgia State University, and Sangwon Lee from Lola Marymount. So they are my co-authors for pursuing this project.
 
[Participant #30]: Wonderful nice to meet you both.
 
H: Nice meeting you.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Good to see you.
 
S: And could you please walk us through a typical day for you, including working hours, and after you work.
 
[Participant #30]: Sure. So today I'm actually working from home. But most of the time I'm in the office. So you know, I would say these days, probably especially, you know, Post Covid, a lot of my meetings are on Zoom. So a lot of times I'm sitting in front of my computer on zoom but you know, I also do meet with alumni off campus a lot. So you know, I'm in a I'm in and out of the office, I would say, I'm I'm more so in the office, you know, working on things but I'll meet alumni for coffee.
You know. Sometimes we have board meetings. I have a board meeting every other month, and that's outside. And then, as far as after work like my personal schedule. Yeah, usually after work I'll head to Pilates over in the marketplace, and then usually come home and have dinner.
You know, and go to bed sometimes I'll you know, I also do some community activities as well. So sometimes I'll you know, meet folks friends at different locations around town or for lunch or dinner. yeah. So that would probably be a typical day. But then, you know, there's different things. I do like traveling or events things like that.
 
S: Okay, thank you very much. This question was quite useful to give you questions regarding how you think about the air quality in Bakersfield. So now just wonder how long you have lived in some hockingbelly.
 
[Participant #30]: I have lived here almost 40 years. So I'm 47.
And I moved here. Yeah, probably 40 years. I think I was 7 when I moved here. So I've lived here most of my life.
 
S: So how do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley?
 
[Participant #30]: It's not good. you know. I think you know, I have a sister who has kids. I don't have any kids of my own. They play sports. They're outdoors a lot and just growing up in the community. I can just remember that. You know, a lot of kids here have asthma problems, you know, traveling back and forth to Los Angeles, coming back down out of the grapevine most of the time. You can see kind of this cloud over the valley.
You can rarely see the mountains, you know. I've said a lot that if if our air quality was better and you could see the mountains as much as you can on a clear day. We'd probably be a lot more populated. Then we are. But yeah, it's we don't have great air quality. And I'm familiar with valley fever, my goddaughter, who's now in her twenties. She got valley fever when she was 5 years old. And yeah, it's a problem.
 
S: when you're young. So we are not knowledgeable about the air quality. But from the moment or experiences we have we. how we form our perception of the air quality.
So since you're 7 years old, you live in Kern County. So how's your perspective on air quality has been changed during those 40 years.
 
[Participant #30]: I think I've become more knowledgeable. You know I as a kid, I didn't realize I didn't know, one way or another that the air quality was bad. I didn't have, you know. Luckily I didn't have asthma growing up. I also didn't play a lot of outdoor sports when I was younger.
But I think as I've gotten older and just learned. you know, traveled more traveled to, you know, areas where there is better air quality. You know, realizing that you know the air quality we have here is probably one of the worst in the country, so I think I've just become more knowledgeable, and then also just seeing folks that I know you know my goddaughter specifically, this was probably 20 years ago that she had valley fever, but just seeing that experience and her go through that. That was kind of eye opening on how scary valley fever can be, especially with young kids. because she she was very sick, and that was a really scary time for her family. Her mom is a good friend of mine, and so I think that we just. You know, I've just kind of through knowledge and also experience have learned more about the effects of the air quality.
 
S: Hmm, okay, thank you. So in what ways does the air quality conditions affect your daily activities?
 
[Participant #30]: You know, I'm definitely more conscious of when it's windy outside, especially if it's very windy. I try not to be outside, or you know I'll wear a mask and you know, try to be indoors more choose, you know, better air filters, I think you know, for my house, for our Hvac system if it is windy and dusty outside, and I'm in my car, you know, turning the A/C. Off, you know, so I don't have air blowing in blowing in on my face. So I'm definitely more, I guess. Kind of kind of conscientious about it now.
 
S: You said, you often take mask, but I also try to take a mask, but when I found that I'm the only one wearing mask. I feel like a little bit, you know.
Pressure, that am. I am the only one who feel the air quality is not good. Am I too sensitive. Have you ever felt some, you know, pressure that I felt.
 
[Participant #30]: Yeah, you know, I don't wear a mask a lot. I probably don't. I don't think about it as much. Honestly, now that we have kind of gone back to like post pandemic.
you know. Kind of lifestyles, if you will. But yeah, I think if I were to wear a mask. Maybe indoors, I would feel. yeah, probably more self-conscious because most people are not wearing masks these days.
 
S: okay, so in in those moments, have you ever felt? Hesitant, to take mask.
 
[Participant #30]: Yeah, I would say, probably.
 
S: Okay, have you modified any work or personal activities due to air quality concerns.
 
[Participant #30]: I would say. It's probably more heat, you know. I mean, I'd love to get outdoors more and do more outdoor activities. But it's so hot here in the summer that kind of goes hand in hand with the air quality.
But I would say probably more because of the heat than the air quality.
 
S: So you said you're using air purifier. But other than that, what kind of actions have you took to deal with the the challenges of the air quality issue.
 
[Participant #30]: I think just not. Going outside would be the main one, or. you know, getting out of town, going over to the central coast where the air is better. As well. but yeah, just not spending a lot of time outside.
S: Have you noticed that the air quality issue impacted on others around you other than your goddaughter?
 
[Participant #30]: I've have so my nephews. I know at least one of them, if not, both of them, have asthma. and they've had asthmatic issues because they both play sports outside.
 
S: So.
 
[Participant #30]: Soccer golf. They're both athletes, and so I know that my older nephew has had issues with asthma when he's spending a lot of time playing sports outdoors.
  
S: How comfortable are people in your workplace with discussing air quality concerns.
 
[Participant #30]: We rarely talk about it. Okay, yeah. Now, are they comfortable? I would say. We probably are comfortable talking about it. But it's not a topic that comes up a lot.
 
S: Only heat that when there's a hot weather they talk about it, but mostly they don't rarely talk about the, You know air quality issue.
 
[Participant #30]: Correct if it's hot, I hear a lot more about it. But if the air quality is bad, folks aren't really talking about it as much as they're talking about the heat.
 
S: Do you think that? The air talking about that there air quality issue is generally connected with you know negative attitude toward that topics around you.
 
[Participant #30]: Yes, yeah, I would say, when folks talk about the air quality, it's always negative. For the most part it's always negative, because we you know, we just have such bad air quality here. So now, you know, on a nice day, when it is a little like lately, it seems like, you know, I don't know if it's because of the wind, but you know, because you can see the mountains better.
Definitely. I feel like folks comment on that more because it's rare to. It's a lot more rare to see the mountains than.
And it isn't so it's, you know. Then people will comment. Oh, it's a nice day outside, you know. We don't have smog that we have. But I would say the majority of comments regarding air quality are negative, because there's a lot of smog here.
 
S: so some people says, if they talk about the airport issue with their colleague always that will lead to the discussion about the political issue right or left. So have you ever thought about that, or felt about that?
 
[Participant #30]: You know I haven't. I definitely have with, you know, personal friends. More conversations about like climate change and you know, and and how politics. You know how political parties, you know, land on that one way or another. I don't really talk about politics with folks at work much so it would be, you know, kind of more general, like comments on the air quality or the smog, but not really getting into like the political sphere of all of it. If that makes sense.
 
S: the reason why, I ask you is that some of the people said in order to block talking about political issue. they rarely, talk about. You know, air quality issue or climate issue, because usually air quality or climate issue is connected to the political. You know, discussions so just wanted to check. Yeah, whether you have the same impression.
 
[Participant #30]: Yeah, I think there's a way to talk about important issues like air quality without having to go into the, you know, without having to talk about political views as well. You know, it's I think it's more of a health issue than a political issue, even though I do know that it can also be very politically contentious. But for me it's more of a health issue than anything.
 
S: Okay, have you ever shared health issue due to the air quality with other colleagues?
 
[Participant #30]: No, I don't think I've really had many health issues due to the air quality again. I don't have asthma now. I do. I did actually have really bad allergies this year. But I would say, that's probably due. And I guess this could be air quality as well. But you know, due to pollen in the air and the agricultural area we live in.
So I guess when I think air quality, I correlate that with smog. But I guess the air quality is also dependent on the agricultural like region that we live in.
So yeah, this year I did have really bad allergies, more so than I usually do, and I felt like I was sick like I had a cold but I do think it was allergies. I was pretty sick for about a week.
  
S: okay, how about your colleagues? Did they share their personal or family concerns or health issues related to air quality with you?
 
[Participant #30]: no, I would say. Probably my nephew, the one who plays sports the most. He has had some breathing issues being outdoors, but not colleagues. That's my sister's, you know. So that would be family.
So, colleagues, you know. I know that they I have had some colleagues who have mentioned. They've had allergies as well. And trying to think if I've had any conversations with folks, you know, when it's dusty. We I have had conversations with colleagues that it's like, make sure we're covering up our faces when and trying to limit our time outside. If it's windy and there's desk getting kicked up. You know, I have talked to a colleague. Actually, I think my colleague, who recommended this interview with you. She and I talked about valley fever, and how you know, over the years we've learned that, like the spores, live in the dust. And so you want to be careful when the dust kicks up, and that's something I learned as an adult. I didn't ever hear anything about valley fever when I was a kid in Bakersfield.
 
S: I heard that 1 10th of the people experience belly fever of their lifetime. And there are, yeah. There are folks who are having Valley fever more than one. So I think I think it could impact many of the people, including including their family members.
 
[Participant #30]: Yeah, I've heard that it it doesn't really ever go away right? It kind of stays dormant, and it can come back.
 
S: So sometimes people feel a sense of connection with others when facing common challenges. So think about Hurricane Katrina. In Florida people had those challenging impact whether they are rich or poor, or aged or young. So they are having same, you know, feelings or impression. So they are having bond each other.
I think we have the same challenges among our people in Kern County, and we understand each other. So when you learn that others share similar environmental concerns like, you know, fear of valley fever. So you told us that you joined this interview because you had talked about valley fever issue. So how does that affect you, so? Do you have any?
Can you describe some feeling you receive when you talk about those kind of concerns you share with your colleagues.
 
[Participant #30]: Sure. So, I'm thinking about an experience that a former provost of ours had, and just learning about her husband getting sick from Valley fever, and this was several several years ago, but they were vacationing in Hawaii, and her husband got really sick. You may have heard this story.
but her husband got really sick, and they didn't know what was wrong with him, and she was doing research on her own, and she was sure that he had Valley fever, but they didn't know anything about it, because they're not from the Central Valley and their medical staff, I guess, didn't know anything about it, and he was very sick. I think he was, you know, close to death from what I've heard. and she was adamant that they look into valley fever, and they finally did, and they figured out that's what he had. And once they started treating that he got better, and I think that their time in Hawaii was, you know, elongated because he couldn't leave, he was so sick.
So then they came home, and he was treated, and he got better. But I. And I think that she started like you know, she got. I think the university more involved in our I don't know if it's research, but we started collaborating more, I think, with the county on valley fever, because of that situation. So as far as feelings, I guess I kind of go back to that, because you know, it just kind of reminded me that a lot of people outside of this area don't know about valley fever, and even medical doctors, you know, in another state. They didn't know anything about it, didn't know how to treat it so. That was kind of scary. So thinking, you know, so I knock on wood. Haven't gotten valley fever, but you know it does make me kind of think what are the symptoms? You know, if I were traveling somewhere else, and I did get really sick, you know.
Is that something I would want to bring up to doctors, depending on what my symptoms are that sort of thing. Now, I don't really think about valley fever to be honest too often unless the wind kicks up. And then I remember those sorts of stories that I've heard. Or, again, my, you know, goddaughter being really sick when she was younger. So it is. I guess the feelings that come up are like fear. you know, and kind of I guess confusion a little bit, because I don't know.
You know I kind of don't know what I don't know, because I haven't gotten Experience valley fever myself. Thank goodness, but yeah, I think that there's fear around around valley fever, for sure.
 
S: Do you think that sharing the valley fever topics with each other, and understanding each other's feelings about the fears against belly fever? Do you think that could help
You and your people feel more connected to each others.
 
[Participant #30]: I think so. I think that folks in the Central Valley like you said we all share either that experience that we know someone who's gotten valley fever, or we all know that we live here. And anyone, you know has the potential to get that. And I think the more that we share about it, and the more knowledgeable we are. You know, knowledge is power. I think it's good to share experiences with others, so that there is that connection. And I do also think it kind of takes people's stress levels down when they have shared experiences and they can openly talk about things. So I don't know if that answered your question.
 
S: Your answer, answered my question very well, thank you very much. How has feeling more connected to others influenced your thought about the air quality issue? Did they change your perspective? Did it change your, you know, behavior toward things around changing the air quality.
 
[Participant #30]: Yeah, I well, when I learned about this interview, and I was talking to my colleague, you know, I mentioned to her the 2 examples I've shared with you of our former provost, and then of my goddaughter. And then I just said, You know I've grown up in Bakersfield so I would be interested in the interview, just because maybe, you know, I'll learn something or I'll have something of value to share. And I think that the research on valley fever is so important, and I know that we've talked about it as a community. More, I would say in the last 1020 years. But we're the only university within, you know, 150 miles, or what have you? So I do think it's important for us to be kind of the leaders in research on the topic.
And there's probably more education that could be done. There's so many kids and families in this community and sports are so big, there's so many kids who are outside. So I think the more we know about valley fever the better off that families in this community will be.
 
S: when I interview people, many of the employees are having so employees from their company, their work schedule is guided by the temperature of each day. but not of the the wind and not of the the air quality itself. So when there's a hot weather, people cannot work.
But if it's a heavy, windy day and lots of dust everywhere, they still work because the temperature's down. So I think we are not having much conversation about the belly fever and the air quality itself, and how it impact beyond air temperature of during the working hours. So one of the reasons we start this interview and this research is to touch upon the awareness of the air quality, and how we could make more conversation around it, so that we can change our community.
And without this discussion we believe that we cannot actually change, because there's no awareness among the people.
 
[Participant #30]: Right? Yeah, I think it's a really good point. And beyond families and children, all of the people who are working in the fields.
For you know, working in Just for the various agricultural companies, and who are out working outside every single day. It's really important. And you know, seeing them wear masks. But is that helpful? Are they wearing the right protective equipment? Is there really enough protective equipment for the spores that are? I mean? I don't. I don't know enough about the science behind it, but just thinking about how many people are working outdoors every day. And you're right. You know they're making a living as well. So it's probably a risk that they're taking because they have to put food on the table.
 
S: Yeah. So the sensitivity on the air quality is quite you know, different between people. Some people think super sensitive, and some people think that the air quality is not an issue they. Some people think that the people who are sensitive to the air quality, they're actually vulnerable to this environment. They're not healthy. So they think that healthy people does not affected by the air quality.
So I just curious about whether you ever felt isolated because of the, you know difference in the sensitivity across people.
 
[Participant #30]: I've never felt isolated, but I don't think it's accurate to say that healthy people don't get valley fever, you know. Obviously my goddaughter was very young when she got valley fever, and so, you know, I know children are more susceptible to viruses sometimes.
But she comes from a very healthy family, you know. Her parents were both like athletic trainers and then I think, the other example I gave. I believe he was a fairly healthy person. And yeah, so I I don't know the science behind it now I haven't. I don't feel like I've ever felt, you know, isolated. Personally.
 
S: Okay, how about how about this? Have you ever felt like you're the only one worried about the belly fever, while others seemed unbothered.
 
[Participant #30]: no, you know. And maybe that's because I work at a university. And so I do feel like maybe we talk about things at the university that maybe others in the community don't talk about as much. I'm not sure.
S: Have you ever wished you could find others who share similar worries about air quality, for example, like belly fever.
 
[Participant #30]: no, I feel like it's a topic that is pretty well known as far as the air quality in the community. Now.
I guess maybe we're just used to it. We're used to the bad air quality in the community. You know, for better or worse. So I know that. You know, I've definitely had conversations with friends over the years about, you know. We wish there was a way that we could improve the air quality here.
And there, just hasn't it? It hasn't seemed like it has improved too much. You know, and especially like talking about when we've had when the fires were really bad. There were terrible fires down in Los Angeles, or, you know, we've had fires to the north. It does seem like. You know, those pollutants tend to get trapped in the valley. So it does seem like the conversation happens more when there are things like fires happening.
as far as far as the air quality. But I would say that I don't feel like I have a lot of friends who are really worried about it. You know, I don't think there's a there is I guess a heightened sense of awareness. There doesn't seem like there is a unless maybe you're with maybe a valley fever or an air quality group. And you're
You know, you are intentionally like advocating for better air quality. I don't feel like it really is a worry, at least, that I have experienced among just general citizens in the valley. And I don't know why that is I feel like. because there isn't a lot folks can do outside of their own personal, you know. places to solve the problem of air quality that people kind of just go about their business and their lives, and don't think about it as much unless something happens directly to them, or a family member or someone close to them.
 
S: Hmm, regarding the air quality issue. What are the general thoughts about your organization's actions regarding air quality? Do you think it's enough.
 
[Participant #30]: I honestly don't feel like we. I don't think as an organization, there's really been much communication around the air quality. Maybe we've gotten some notifications every once in a while, if it's particularly bad. But honestly, as an organization, I don't really think it's addressed with employees. I would say more, you know I would see it on my weather app, or I would see it through the news or something, but as an organization. I don't believe we talk about air quality too much. Yeah, with staff.
  
S: When there's a heavy wind. And my eyesight was really short because of the dust. And many of the students email me like, 30 min before the class starts. My class was 5 Pm. And until then I didn't realize that I can cancel the class because of the air quality. because at the time. This was my second semester at Csub.and this is my 1st experience that the air quality is not good in America, and I've never imagined that there are. There are people in America, that is, who are suffering from the air quality.
But as we are living in Bakersfield, I began to realize that the the air quality issue is the many of the people in you know current county are suffering from the air quality issue, including, you know. belly fever. So like me. 
Have you ever thought about you wanted to change the schedule of the work, events or work schedule, or your subordinates work, schedule, or meeting time due to the air quality.
 
[Participant #30]: we haven't really rescheduled anything. Yeah, due to the air quality.
I mean, that makes sense, though, like, if but I would just say, if we did have an outdoor event, and let's say there was a lot of wind. We would probably look at bringing that indoors. I haven't experienced that but that's definitely something we would consider in the future, because we wouldn't want to have an event outdoors if the dust is kicking up, and it's really windy.
 
S: And changing the schedule of the event is brings so many risks because we spend so many time and resources to advertise that event. But if we change it, then we will, you know, lose tons of people joining that event. But I know that's a really hard decision, and I totally understand that.
So in order to make people, you know. deal with the air quality issue in a better way. What kind of support or initiative do you think that our University can provide to us.
 
[Participant #30]: I think probably you know facts, factual information. you know the science behind. you know what are like the long term health effects. Of the bad air quality, because I feel like a lot of people who are from this community who really don't know any better kind of take for granted the fact that this isn't normal. and I would say that probably for myself as well. Because I've grown up here. I kind of. Take for granted that well, this is where I live, and it's just the air quality here is bad, and that, you know.
just know not to go out, but I think I think just the educational piece of it, like, you know, it's not normal for the air quality to be this bad, and I don't know if valley fever is something that other folks get around the country or in other parts of the world. Not that I've heard of, but I think you know just kind of that educational piece, and that we are. and that we're sharing information that's helpful for our community and trying to help people make better choices in their life. So I think, you know, providing the information that we have about the air quality is important. And you know it's up to individuals to make their own choices. But I think you know the science behind it. The health effects, the you know, education behind the air quality. I think that folks would see us as a resource if we were a little more present in us, sharing the information that we know, and that we have.
 
S: thank you. And regarding the organizational support, what would need to change at our university for you to feel. or the others feel more comfortable, saying, I'm struggling with today's air quality.
 
[Participant #30]: I guess, as far as structure goes. you know, just being able to kind of have an avenue that says the what you know, if the university is being proactive, saying, you know, it's okay. If we're having a bad air quality day where you stay home, you work from home that sort of thing, and I feel like that probably does happen across campus in pockets. But I don't think it's like a systematic.
Structured way like you're talking about. I haven't felt like I wanted to. You know, I couldn't go into the office because of the air quality. Again, I've grown up here, but you know someone who is new to the community, who is like, I'm not used to this kind of air quality. You know, it doesn't really seem very healthy to be outside. Then I could see that being, you know, kind of more of an issue. I don't know if I've had any coworkers or folks I supervise. I don't think I've had anyone who's said. You know I don't feel comfortable coming into work because of the air quality.
 
S: okay, thank you very much. And last question, is there anything else you'd like to share with us about your experiences with air quality in San Joaquin Valley that we haven't discussed.
 
[Participant #30]: I don't think so. I guess it would just be kind of interesting to know how's the air quality improved, or has it gotten worse over the last 20-30 years in the summer, when there isn't, you know, a lot of wind, and things sit in the valley, you know?
Are people getting sicker? Or you know, obviously, when there is wind? Yeah, what are the rates of valley fever? How often are there kind of spikes. you know, throughout the year those sorts of things. So just some things I'm curious as we about as we've been talking.
 
S: Okay, thank you very much. So after this interview we will establish the model and test with a weekly, bi-weekly survey for 11 weeks.
So we will test a survey during the fall semester, where the air quality is not good compared to other season. I might contact you when I distribute the survey to see whether we can, you know, advertise this survey to our alum network. If that is, you know, available.
 
[Participant #30]: Sure. Yeah, I'd be happy to chat with our alumni board about it. We have social media channels as well. And yeah, be happy to talk more about it.
 
S: Okay, great. Thank you very much, Participant #30. Nice to meeting you, and I hope you have a great day.
