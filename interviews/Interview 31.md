P31: Good.
S: I will! My colleagues will joining our interview. Here's Sung Hyoun Hong from Georgia State University. 
P31: Hey, hi! How are you?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Good! How are you?
P31: Good.
S: Yeah. For the next semester two of my students also joining student research scholar program.
S: And I think this project has been spotlight from your office.
S: and you know we took a video with [name of research assistant].
P31: Oh, yeah, I remember that.
S: And I think [name of research assistant], who is also MBA Student of our program, will continue to do this project. But mostly this project is conducted with my colleague Sung Hyoun Hong from Georgia State University, and Sang-Hoon Lee from Loyola Marymount.
P31: Nice. Okay. Cool.
S: Okay, thank you. And thanks for volunteering for this interview. I really appreciate that.
P31: Yeah, of course.
S: Yeah. And after this interview we will send you a $40 Amazon gift card. And if you feel comfortable,
S: can we record this meeting for the purpose of transcribing our discussion.
P31: Yeah, that's totally fine.
S: Thank you. And after we complete reviewing the transcription, we will delete the recording and also change all your name or
S: other information that could detect your personal identification will be replaced with capital A or B.
P31: Sounds good.
S: Okay, so let's talk about your current role and responsibility first. P31, can you tell us about your current role in your job?
P31: So currently, I am the annual giving and stewardship coordinator here at [name of workplace]. I work in our [name of deparment].
S: Okay, does. Your work requires physical presence like, do you need to? Come to your office for your work?
P31: Yes, so I am here. Well, during the summer we're here four days a week. But during the semesters we're here five days a week.
S: Okay. If there's a chance that personal reason, or if the weather is not good can you ask your manager that
S: you want to work at your home or other place other than your office?
P31: I could. But unionwise. It's not really in my contract to work from home, I mean, I would have to get like prior HR
P31: approvals to work from home, and I don't have those. But I have. I have a good enough relationship with my manager that if I said, I'm not
P31: able to come into the office. Could I work from home? He would be okay. But I don't really have that ability.
S: Okay? So there's there's a pre process that before you request for working at your home right?
P31: Yes.
S: Okay, can you walk us through a typical day for you include, including your working hours and outside of your working hours.
P31: Yeah. So I, typically, I come into the office around 8 AM. I'm in my office from 8 till about 11. Then I get a little bit cold in here, so I'll walk across campus. Go to Starbucks, get
P31: a drink, or whatever. Just get some fresh air and warm up a little bit. Get back to the office. Do work for about 2 or 3 more hours, and then again go outside to get warm.
P31: And take a walk again. And then I leave around 5 o'clock. So that's a typical typical day. And then after that I'll get home around 5:30. Walk, my dog, we'll do about a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood.
P31: And yeah. Then, after that, I turn in for the day. It's usually just being inside.
S: Yeah, it seems like you really enjoy walking outside. And it seems like you're an outdoor person.
P31: Yeah, I when where I'm from. I was much more outside than I am here. So I I do miss that. So I try to be more outdoorsy here.
S: So P31. How long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley, I mean Kern County? So you said you lived outside of the Bakersfield.
P31: So I've lived in Kern County my entire life, but I've only lived in Bakersfield for the last four years?
P31: Oh sorry 3 years. No, I graduated 4 years ago. So 3 years. Yeah.
S: Yeah, actually, current count is quite huge. It's including, you know. You know, antelope. So which place did you live before?
P31: So I lived in [name of town], so I lived on top of the grapevine.
S: Oh, I remember, I remember your email, yeah.
P31: Yeah.
S: I live in Stevens Ranch of [name of area], and actually I always pass down [name of area].
P31: Yeah. So that's why. Yeah, it was. That's why I said, I love to get outside more and do hiking and things like that, and it's much easier to be outside up there than it is here.
S: And my 2 of my close friend who's participated in my research.
P31: Yeah.
S: They are from [name of area], actually.
P31: Oh, we talked a lot.
S: Yeah.
P31: Oh, I wonder if I know them all up there.
S: Yeah. So how do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley? I know there are huge difference between, you know, Fraser park and there you live currently live.
P31: I definitely have noticed a difference.
P31: I would say, in my day to day life like just
P31: today I woke up with like a scratchy throat. I notice every day I wake up with a scratchy throat. I've started to have to sleep with a humidifier, actually, because of how dry the air is.
P31: I've
P31: I do actually really cherish the days after it rains, because I notice that the air is a lot cleaner and just nicer. So I yeah, I really do notice a big difference. But,
P31: especially in my health and my colleagues and I we discuss it a lot, the air quality, especially in
P31: kind of the springtime when they're, I call it shaking the trees when they're harvesting the almonds and the crops and things like that, I really notice a change in the air quality, because my allergies get a lot worse. My eyes are itching, nose, I tend to get a lot sicker.
P31: So yeah, I've noticed that I do have to take a lot more sick days than I used to have to. I was. I was primarily a very healthy person. But I think my allergies have definitely gotten a lot worse since moving primarily to the San Joaquin Valley. So I've definitely noticed a very big difference.
S: I totally understand your experience, because I moved from Pittsburgh, where the air quality is quite good.
S: And I didn't realize that there are part of the United States that the air is not good. There are stereotype that you know
S: American are enjoying the with the good, you know, environment.
S: But actually, there are part, actually, it's not right.
P31: Yeah.
S: So since you lived in San Joaquin Valley, has your perspective on air quality issue changed during that time?
P31: Oh, yeah, definitely. I I honestly never thought about it before. I moved to San Joaquin Valley. And now it's pretty much my day to day life? So I would say, I definitely think about it. Yeah, every day.
S: So you moved to Bakersfield because of your undergraduate program?
P31: So I moved. Well, I moved after my undergraduate program. I actually moved here because my boyfriend lived here so.
S: Okay. So you took the master’s program then?
P31: Yeah, so well, I actually, I'm in the master's program now. But I originally I was working remotely. I was living with my boyfriend, and then I started working at CSUB. And now I'm in the master's program.
S: Oh, okay, got it. So since you moved to Bakersfield, for your first year, have you realized that the air quality is bad?
P31: Yeah.
S: Okay. And how does that perspective change over over the years?
P31: I've definitely it's weird because
P31: I don't want to say that I've felt worse.
P31: But and I don't want to attribute it to like my age, but like I've
P31: I've noticed as I've lived here longer, that, like the lasting effects I feel like of the air quality, have, just like like my allergies, for example. The first year
P31: didn't really notice them that much. It was a sneezing, whatever the second year I was like. Oh, my gosh! It sucks to go outside, you know. Can't really, you know, go outside in the springtime without eyes itching, sneezing. I have to take allergy pills every day now. Things like that. Now it's literally like I have to
P31: sleep with a humidifier, just to be able to not have like dry mouth or blow my nose all the time. Take allergy pills. So it's like, progressively as the years have gone on, I've noticed, like adding another step into my routine.
P31: And so, like I said, I don't. Wanna I don't know if that's attributing to my age, or like attributing that to my age and the air quality. But I've definitely noticed, like just drier, like drier things,
P31: and trust me, like, when I go outside, I definitely notice
P31: the smog and just the conditions for the day. And I'm like, I can tell what kind of day it's gonna be. If you know what I mean, like, I can tell how I'm gonna feel that day.
S: Okay, I think that's a good example, that how the air quality affect your daily activities.
S: Did the air quality impact
S: how you work in your workplace?
P31: Definitely I do. There's actually
P31: some days where I know I've noticed it.
P31: It kind of happens on like, I'll notice it like on Wednesdays. I'll start to feel
P31: kind of like run down, and I'll be like, oh, you know, is it? Is it the air quality like what's going on and like, I just I thought it was, you know, working whatever. But as I like, talk to my colleagues and things like that, they're like, no, it's literally it's gotta be the air quality but we notice that we get run down, and it's like by Friday I will literally have like
P31: cold like symptoms. If that makes sense. Like I'll have
P31: sore throat, runny nose things like that. And it's like by Saturday, I need to be like in bed,
P31: taking it easy, kind of just like resting, because it's like, I literally just feel like run down, you know, and I don't know if it's cause cause, especially in my office. I sit in the front of our office, so our main door is opening and closing all the time. So I'm especially like at the front and center of that every day. So I feel like I'm definitely at.
P31: you know, harm's way when it comes to that. So yeah, I've definitely noticed when it comes to like being at work like, I like, by the end of the week, I'm like, yeah, I need to like, take a break, and it's not even like I'm getting less sleep like I'm literally getting eight hours a day like I prioritize my health, I prioritize sleep, and I still will be like,
P31: Oh, my God! Like I need to take a break.
S: So considering…
Sung Hyoun Hong: I have one follow up question. So it seems like you've come to understand or know the air quality issues in Bakersfield more over time. So I was wondering, was the air quality itself was similar, I mean, consistently bad, and you just became more aware of it as you lived there longer, or has the air quality itself actually gotten noticeably worse over time?
P31: I I think it's been the same. I've just become more aware because my boyfriend he's lived here his entire life, and he's like, oh, I'm used to this like this has been a thing my entire life, and I'm like, you know, I'm from the mountains where air is
P31: beautiful, you know, 24, 7, 3, 365 days a year. So I was like, really like, you just live like this. So, as I've you know, lived here longer. I've become more aware. And I'm like, you know, cause in the valley it just all just sits here. And it is really heavy. And yeah, yeah, I've just become more aware. I think it's always just been like this.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thanks for the clarification.
S: So you said, you talk about the air quality issue with your colleagues. Have you noticed that the air quality also impacts on others around you? I know your boyfriend has quite resilience from the air quality. But how about the others?
P31: Yeah, I actually, umm, one of my colleagues. She moved from the Antelope Valley to Bakersfield, and we talk about the air quality every day, like she'll be,
P31: she'll come up to my desk and she'll be like, I just. I don't feel good today like it's the air or something like that, so we'll literally talk about it all the time. So she she notices a big difference.
P31: And you know my other colleague, he's from the Bay Area. He notices the difference, too. He especially had to get a full panel of allergy tests because he was out for like a week.
P31: Because he couldn't figure out like he was like coughing, sneezing, eyes like swollen shut, and he was like what is going on? And it was the week that they were harvesting almonds and things like that. And
P31: he literally was like allergic and couldn't figure it out, and it was just floating around in the air. And so he had to get a whole panel of tests done. And so yeah, so we've definitely all talked about it, noticed it. And it's kind of like almost a running joke in our office of oh, it's just the air quality.
P31: So yeah, we've all we've kind of talked about it. We've all noticed it.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Just curious. Do you know if he and she also from Bakersfield or somewhere else?
P31: So she's from, she was born and raised in the Antelope Valley, so like Lancaster area, and he was born in like Modesto, so like Northern California, and then he moved to like San Francisco, and then he moved to Bakersfield from San Francisco.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Gotcha.
P31: Yeah.
S: So it seems like your colleagues, and you are quite comfortable talking about air quality issue.
P31: Yeah.
S: maybe because you guys are all all moved from other region. Maybe so. But are you also comfortable? Talking about this air quality issue with the people who's quite resilient with the bad air quality, like people who has been born and raised in Bakersfield?
P31: I think so. One of actually, my director [name of director] he was, he lived here for quite a few years when he was a kid and in his teenage years and then obviously moved back.
P31: about four or five years ago. So I would say he's lived here a good majority of his life. But we tease him a lot because he's like, oh, I don't, you know, notice the air that much, and we're like, really? Like
P31: I mean, I know
P31: oh, you love Bakersfield. But come on like you gotta notice there's something wrong here.
S: Okay. I think we all share a commonality because we all, from the other, you know region and settle down to Bakersfield. And we share the same thing. But I think there's a kind of kind of small gap between us and the people who, you know, born and raised in Bakersfield.
S: So have you ever felt like lonely when the folks around you did not quite understand your concern about the air quality?
P31: I would say, yeah, a a little bit like like my boyfriend, for instance, was
P31: He kind of will shrug me off and just be like, Oh, like, it's just Bakersfield, like, you know, that's kind of the feeling around Bakersfield as though it's just Bakersfield. So yeah, I would say, a lot of people have just accepted the fact, if that makes any sense. So yeah, I would say it is. It is quite lonely, especially because I mean.
P31: my office doesn't feel lonely because a lot of us are not from here, but the surrounding areas like my friends outside of the office. Yeah, they they're just kind of like they shrug me off because they're like, Oh, this is normal, like, this is just Bakersfield. You'll learn to accept it. And I'm like, okay, cool.
S: So outside of your office, I think you're you're in a really good environment where your colleagues can understand your, you know concerns. But outside of your office,
S: can you describe a general attitudes toward, you know?
S: When people talk about the air quality issue and the CSUB?
P31: Uhh, sorry can I? Don't think I understand. Like how they refer to CSUB or
S: So can you describe peoples outside of CSUB, their general attitude toward talking about air quality issue?
P31: Oh, I mean I mean, typically they
P31: outside of the office. We don't really talk about it. It's like my friends and I aren't
P31: talking about. It's like my boyfriend and I, because we're together all the time we obviously discuss it. But, like my friends and I, it's not a huge topic of conversation. One of my friends who is, she's an alum, we've discussed it before, but that's because we go hiking, it like
P31: [park name]
P31: and when it's hot and the air quality isn't particularly great. We'll notice, like the huffing and puffing and things like that, and we'll mention it. But it's not really a huge topic of conversation. So unfortunately, I don't have that much to to speak on about that. But
P31: yeah.
S: Have you ever wanted to take, you know, mask or
S: put air purifier around you, but felt hesitant to due to social concerns or pressure?
P31: I've not wanted the only I've wanted to put air purifiers in my house.
P31: Unfortunately, you know, the good ones are quite expensive, so I've held off on doing that. But the masks, because it's so hot, the only, that's the only thing that's kept me from doing that, because
P31: you know, I am a female, so wearing makeup all the time. That's my only thing is like from here, like it'll take my whole makeup off. So that's my one concern. But yeah, no, I've considered doing air purifiers. It's just with economics. I haven't had the the means to get any yet.
S: Yeah, since your desk is in front of the door always, or occasionally open from the visitors, have you ever considered asking
S: I, requesting air purifier to your manager?
P31: I actually have not I uhh
P31: I mean with concerns of, you know, working in the CSU and budgetary things like that I know how
P31: hard things are, so I'm quite cognizant of our budget and things like that. So I have never actually asked. But now that you bring that up, I might actually ask.
S: We care about the well-being of our fox.
P31: And also our student.
S: Exactly.
S: We need to, you know, aim for our own health as well.
P31: Yeah, no joke. I'm actually gonna bring that up to him.
S: Okay, so you said, you're quite comfortable talking about air quality issue with your colleague, right? But why do you think you're comfortable talking about that issue with your colleague? I think that's a kind of unique environment.
P31: I think, because
P31: well, it's funny, because my, I consider my colleagues also, like my friends, like my one colleague who's from Lancaster. She's like,
P31: almost like a friend, but also like a second mom to me in a way. So I feel really comfortable talking to her about like anything. So I feel comfortable talking to her about air quality. How I'm feeling things like that.
P31: And really talking to my colleagues because we spend so much time together. It's almost like they're your friends as well. So yeah, I just feel comfortable talking to them about really anything, because it's like we spend so much time together that we're we're basically friends.
S: Okay I'm kind of thinking about how you became a close colleague? So how did
S: talk kind of understanding about your each other's concern about the air quality, how that help the connection or relationship with your colleagues.
P31: I think,
P31: well, sorry. I think I'm trying to understand the question a little bit more. So you're saying?
S: So to rephrase. When we talk about, you know common
S: challenges we face, and if we understand each other's.
S: we feel some connection with each other, and we feel like we understand more about them because we voluntarily revealed our, you know, vulnerability.
S: And that could lead to kind of good relationship with our colleagues. So I'm just talking about, did you experience those kind of
S: those experiences that talking about the air quality issue
S: influence positively to the good relationship.
P31: Oh, oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, I think the first step of like kind of
P31: growing that friendship or that relationship is kind of starting to talk about how you feel and like opening up so, especially like if you come into work and you're just completely closed off. You're not talking to anybody. You're just sitting there doing your work. Obviously you're not going to make friends with your colleagues and things like that. But, like my manager [Manager name], for instance, I'll come in and I'll be like.
P31: Oh, you know. I have a scratchy throat today, like, you know, could it be the air or something like that, you know, and he genuinely cares about that. And so you know, I consider him a friend, and even you know, my friend [name of coworker/friend], I'll we'll be talking about the same thing like if we walk outside. And we're like, Oh, my! Gosh! Like you see the smog today, or something like that like
P31: he'll easily be like, Oh, yeah, you know, I had to. He uses these
P31: little like Vicks
P31: sticks to breathe and so he'd be like, Oh, yeah, I'm carrying my vicks stick today, or whatever I've had to use it like this many times, or things like that. So I think, yeah, developing those relationships. And just like
P31: getting like sharing more about your experience and how you're feeling that helps develop those relationships. Because otherwise, like you're you're kind of just closed off, you know. If you're you're not,
P31: you're not going to develop those relationships if you don't share.
P31: You know
P31: what you're feeling or how you're feeling, and especially, you know, air quality. If you say I'm not feeling good today, you know, people are actually gonna care and be like, oh, well, like what's going on, you know, and gives you the reason to open up.
S: I think that's a really great point that I didn't thought about. Do you think that sharing your experiences with your colleagues about [colleague name]?
S: Pollution could also
S: make you feel connected to the organization? So those kind of sharing experiences could make a good bond with your colleague. But how about the relationship between you and the organization itself.
P31: I I definitely think so. I mean, like, for instance, like CSUB,
P31: like as an organization, I know last year,
P31: yeah, it was my first year they had implemented. I mean, I know you know
P31: well-being, health, and well-being of employees is, you know, top tier for CSUB and they had the Blue Zones project come and you know, work with
P31: employees to kind of get them out of the office and like walking around campus, but I was, on the other hand, like I don't want to walk outside and like be outside, you know, like I was, on the other hand of like. I don't want to be breathing outside kind of thing. So I mean, I think
P31: I like prioritizing the health and well-being of the employees is top tier. But I also think, like the organization,
P31: if, like, for instance.
P31: putting air purifiers in the office, a hundred percent like that could grow the relationship with the organization. Like, I think,
P31: like doing things like that, like would definitely
P31: be helpful. Like, I think, yeah.
S: I think CSUB is concerned for their students and faculty members and staff's, you know, health.
S: and I think mainly their focus is on, you know, food intake, or temperature, or.
P31: Hmm
S: Or COVID, and also they started to talk about how valley fever is critical for our health.
S: But in general I haven't found that they are really
S: talking about air quality, general air, quality, like, you know, kind of dust in the quality of the air, which is heavily, you know, related to the with the dust in the air.
S: So have you also thought about that the CSUB need to put more effort on, you know, training people how we need to deal with the air quality?
P31: I definitely think so. And I actually like the fact that you brought up valley fever like I didn't. I didn't even think about that, because,
P31: you know.
P31: Having it be kicked up by wind like windstorms and things like that is like one of my biggest fears, because, you know
P31: having, like Covid, is one thing, it's, you know, spread by germs and things like that. But for a windstorm to spread Valley fever, and it's in the air. It's like that was one thing that scared me. So I think if CSUB could educate people on, you know the air quality, how to
P31: better maintain like, even if we had like better facilities to maintain better air quality. Because I know specifically in my building like
P31: the air quality isn't great like we, we feel it definitely like there's there's other buildings on campus that have better air quality. So I think just better equipping buildings with air quality. And then, just yeah, informing people like, this, the CSU learning trainings or things that we have to do. I think we could build one on air quality. I mean,
P31: it could be hard to just do one for Bakersfield. I understand that. But just yeah, just educating people or sending out a bulletin or something like that. I think that would be super helpful. But yeah, I think there's a lot of unknowns about the air quality, because I mean, obviously, I'm not doing studies like you guys are. So I don't know half of what you guys are
P31: you know, learning about. So just, you know, having some sort of idea would be helpful, because, you know, I don't know what is going on. What's in the air, what's really happening. So you know if I could learn how to, you know, prevent some things from happening, it would be super helpful. And if CSUB could, you know, put something out that, would, you know, help me about that? That would be really really good, I think.
S: Okay.
S: as you think that CSUB can do more about taking care about the air quality issue, have you ever felt isolated, due to the environmental health concerns related to air pollution, or, you know, air quality?
P31: I wouldn't say so very much.
P31: No, I don't think so.
S: How about how about this? Have you ever had specific moments that you felt? You think you are worried about the air quality? But the others seemed unbothered.
P31: Oh, hmm, potentially.
P31: I think, and that goes back to like like as an employee, and because it
P31: it's difficult being an employee of a large organization, because
P31: you're just a very small fish in a very big pond. So it
P31: it is very difficult if you have a concern because it
P31: it's really hard to go up the chain if you and if you know what I mean. So yeah, I do, I do feel
P31: that in a sense like, if I did have a concern in a sense like that, like if I said, oh, we could do this like, I feel like it would fall on deaf ears. So, yeah, I I do feel that.
S: Yeah, so we, our organization supports for
S: diversity and inclusion all we know. So there's a small group that supports Black community, Asian community, and Hispanic community. But have you ever thought that you are the minority that the group of people who are really sensitive to the air quality issue?
S: Because many of the people here
S: think that the air quality is not good, but they're actually don't think that I think, they actually think that they can actually live with it.
P31: I, I don't, because
P31: I mean, thank God, I'm not one of those who suffers from like asthma or things, like, that so in that sense
P31: I I don't feel like a minority in that sense. So I I would like categorize myself as not a minority. So I would just, you know, want to advocate for those who do have asthma, and, you know, want to give them more of a platform, so that you know I'd rather not take resources for myself when, you know, they would need them more than I would. You know.
S: Okay.
S: if you could speak completely open about the air quality concerns at work like, you know, asking, you know, mask or air purifier to your manager, or, you know, change your schedule.
S: Outdoor schedule, depend on the air quality outside. What do you think,
S: what kind of change our organization have?
P31: I definitely, I think that
P31: I mean my organization like [name of department].
P31: thankfully, is very flexible, like, I thank my lucky stars that I have such a great division. Because, we are able to have like understanding managers and things like that, and
P31: anything that like, If I were to say, you know I am very sensitive to air quality and things like that, and I do need to work from home. And I do have these senses, and we could take the necessary steps to either. Have me work from home, get an air purifier things like that. So I definitely don't feel like like isolated in that sense of like,
P31: I'm completely stuck and like there's no way that this could happen so thankfully, I I don't feel alone in that sense. But yeah, I definitely think that if if I needed to, I definitely can make things happen. So thank God that that's that's an option. But yeah, I don't. I don't feel like it's it's as bad as it as other people have it.
P31: I hear horror stories from other other people [name of workplace], and I just thank God that that's not my situation.
S: Okay, thank you. This is the last question. So we are doing research
S: interviewing people. And we need to do several more more than ten. Is there any any other questions you think that we need, we can provide to the future interviewees?
P31: Umm…I don't really think so. I think you guys were pretty comprehensive.
S: Okay. Great.
P31: Yeah, I think they pretty much covered every little, every little thing.
S: Thank you very much. So this is we complete the interview, and I just for the follow up. We may ask you to participate in the survey research. It is also compensated, so it will be conducted for 11 weeks.
P31: Okay.
S: So it's also compensated. So is it.
S: are you? If you're comfortable, can I send you an email about that survey participation opportunity.
P31: Yeah, absolutely.
S: Okay, great. It's nice to see you, P31, and I hope you have a great day.
P31: Thank you.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Actually, I have one more question.
P31: Yes.
Sung Hyoun Hong: If you don't mind. So when you talk about the air quality, people respond
Sung Hyoun Hong: really differently, I will say, like some people may say, Oh, that is just Bakersfield thing, or some people may say, this is what it is, but while others might really empathize and even share their own struggles with air quality, and, like you said that definitely influence your relationship with those people? Right? But my question is,
Sung Hyoun Hong: does that difference also change how you feel about the air quality issue itself?
P31: Oh, you mean like, if somebody is like, oh, that's just Bakersfield like, does that change?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Some people may react more positively, and some people might react more negatively I will say.
P31: No, absolutely absolutely not. I. I tend to say that because I'm,
P31: I'm a mountain girl through and through like, I will say that
P31: If I can leave the valley I would do that as fast as possible. So I say that this is just a stopping point for me so. No, I do not say that does not change my opinion in any way. So I just you know it's it's kind of like somebody
P31: like disproving your feelings in a way. So if I said like oh, I don't feel good, or whatever like them saying, Oh, you're just making it up, or whatever like
P31: that's you know you're you're not me. You're not changing. You're not
P31: feeling how I'm feeling, you know, in a way. So no, it would not influence my opinion at all.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Gotcha.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah. And in terms of those, the negative, no, I will say more, the neutral responses. Do you think there is some commonality behind some of
Sung Hyoun Hong: the more I will say, indifferent or dismissive reaction people give like, maybe it's not that they don't care about you, but more than,
Sung Hyoun Hong: more that they don't want to seem weak, or they want to
Sung Hyoun Hong: come across as strong I will say?
P31: Yeah, maybe I think I think a lot of people just
P31: like to just, you know, chalk it up to
P31: it's whatever, and maybe just get the conversation over with. So yeah, maybe it's just they don't want to seem weak, or, you know.
P31: be whatever I I honestly don't know. I've never really encountered somebody that was neutral about it. It's always just been somebody that was either super positive or super negative about it. But yeah, I feel like if it, if they were just super negative, was probably just because they're trying to end the conversation.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Okay.
P31: Yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Great. Thank you.
P31: Yeah, thank, you.
S: Thank you. This is it for the today's interview? I've just sent you a gift card, and thanks for your participation and valuable time.
P31: Awesome. Thank you. Have a good day.
H: Thank you so much.
