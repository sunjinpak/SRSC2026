# Interview 21

## Transcript
 
[Participant #21]: So I work for Bakersfield College. And I do. I do educational advising.
But I graduated from Cscb. In fall of 2023. So I got 2 bachelors there. I got one in business administration with the HR, Then I got one in psychology.
 
S: Okay, great psychology is backbone of human resource management. So I think you got a good mentor for pursuing those majors.
 
[Participant #21]: Yes.
 
S: Okay? So in your current job, do they require physical presence like you? Do you need to be in that office in person?
 
[Participant #21]: Yes, I I'm in my office all day.
 
S: And also are there any flexibility in working in certain time? So for a certain day you might not come to the office in a regular time, because of some issue.
 
[Participant #21]: no. So like, if I like, yeah, we like, say, if I have to miss work, they don't give us the ability to say, like, Okay, I work from home, you know I'm not feeling good or no. So no. So like, if I have like, I suffer from migraines, and it's with the airport, with the bad air they get worse, so it's either I come in or I don't come in.
 
S: Okay. Haydee, I totally understand you. I have a migraine since I was second grade. And I have a migraine once a week at least.So I totally understand you.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah. So like in the last, I think I've had one for the last 2 weeks. And like, I get really bad pressure.
It's like it hurts my face like it's inside pressure. And I think this is the worst one I've had. This lasted 2 weeks, but I do see a neurologist for the last what 4 or 5 years, because of the how bad the air quality has gotten and the migraines just keep getting worse and worse.
 
S: Okay. Do you take any medicine? I take triptan.
 
[Participant #21]: So I did. Triptan. Yeah, I did triptan, and it wouldn't work.
So I get botox injections. Every 3 months. Yeah.
 
S: Did that work.
 
[Participant #21]: That works, but then I still have to have ibuprofen on the side.
 
S: I have a profan as my friend as well. Okay. Oh, gosh, yeah. Let's refocus on air quality. I can talk with you about migraine whole day. But yes.
 
S: Can you walk us through a typical day for you, including your work hour and after your work, hour.
 
[Participant #21]: So right now, we're like in summer schedule. So we we get Fridays off. So I work 7 to 5, 30. And then so usually like I come in. I check if I have any appointments with any students or anything, and then I have. Right now I have 30 min lunch, so like, usually, if I have a really bad migraine, everybody knows like I have to keep my lights off, so I usually have to keep my lights off if I have a really bad migraine.
I even had to see a weight specialist because I was gaining weight from just sitting at my desk. So I have to walk around on my lunch. But then, if the air quality is bad like I really can't do it. So I use our library to kind of walk inside for a little bit. Then that has helped, but usually, and then, after work, usually, my kids are already out of the house. They don't live with me anymore. So usually me and my husband, either we go play golf, or just kind of hang out, go have dinner. So yeah.
 
S: Okay. Oh, I didn't know that your kids is already grown up. Yours so look young.
 
[Participant #21]: My youngest just graduated from here from BC. So she'll be in the fall at Csub.
 
S: Okay. Okay. Looking forward to seeing your daughter.
Okay, so how do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Vallue?
 
[Participant #21]: I think it's really bad. So I grew up in Palm Springs area. I was born over there, so I came over here probably like in my teenage years. And that's when I noticed that the my mom migraines that I had migraines, and even like sometimes I go on vacation and doesn't feel as bad.
 
 
S: So did your parents also felt the same way like you.
 
[Participant #21]: My mom did. My mom would get migraines.
But she passed away 5 years ago from a brain aneurysm.
 
S: So you lived in San Joaquin Vallue for quite a while since your teenage year, and. Has your perspective on air quality issues or problems changed during that time?
 
[Participant #21]: So. Can you repeat that.
 
S: So since you lived in San Joaquin Valley, I mean Kern County, have your evaluation on air quality here has been changed during that time.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah, like, I guess I didn't realize that it was this bad or what would cause it, and to eventually like there was other people that I started meeting. That was like, Oh, yeah, you know. So then that's when I started looking into a neurologist. And that's where I said, well, yeah, the air quality triggers. It.
 
S: So your friends actually influence your perspective on how bad the air quality is here in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #21]: Yes.
 
S: Okay, other than that. Do you have any specific moment or events or conversation that changed your thought about air quality.
 
[Participant #21]: I think just talking with every day, like, you know, if conversations with people that I work with or friends, that's I mean, that's the time that I probably talk about it. The most.
 
S: Okay, did your children also suffer from the air quality like you.
 
[Participant #21]: My youngest. She doesn't have asthma, but she does say that she could feel it like on her breathing. Sometimes.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: And one question, have you started getting migraines since moving to the Bakersfield.
So, and have they been getting worse over time? Or it is kind of stable.
 
[Participant #21]: Right now they're stable. But I think in the last month that's when I've had the worst.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Gotcha? And do you feel like, it is worse during a period of like heavy dust or heat?
 
[Participant #21]: Yes.
 
S: so you said, when the air quality is bad you cannot walk outside of your building, you walk inside the library, but other than that. In what ways do air quality conditions affect your daily activities?
 
[Participant #21]: I think it's mostly like in the migraines. I think the.
 
S: So have you modified any work or personal activities due to the air quality concerns like, sometime we could see heavy dust outside, with the heavy wind.
 
[Participant #21]: Well, usually like. I guess it has limit like to how much I go outside because of it. If the air quality is bad, I just try to stay inside as much as I can.
So it limits from, you know, being out in the community, or anything.
 
S: Okay, got it. Have you ever had a moment to cancel any events because of the bad air quality.
 
[Participant #21]: Well, there's been times that we get invited to things, and if the air quality is better, just because I already know if I come out there. It's gonna it's gonna really give me a bad migraine. So I just rather not go.
 
S: Okay.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: It seems like you enjoy golfing. If I misunderstand, please apologize. But have you ever had a reschedule rounding, or change your plans because of the air quality issues.
 
[Participant #21]: Yes. So if, like we've got invited to birthday parties, and if they're outside one group. it has really bad air, like, I just won't go.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Have you also adjusted any of your work activities or work meetings or appointments?
 
[Participant #21]: For work. Not so much because of my I'm in my office most of the day.
It's me from like leaving it for lunch.
 
S: So, until now, we talked about how air quality impact your life. And let's talk about how air quality impact others around you like your family friends or coworkers. Have you noticed how the air quality impact?
 
S: Your friends or others around you.
 
[Participant #21]: So my husband he gets migrate as well.
So both of us like I think we just kind of pull through it, but he like, we have, like the same reaction, sometimes on the same like, if it's a bad day, we're just like both, constantly like, Okay, we gotta go to sleep early today because we've had a horrible migraine all day, or usually in the mornings. We can wake up with a migraine, so we have to kind of go back to sleep for a while and then wake back up. But it's like we're kind of. Usually we notice, because it's like both of us will start feeling migraines around the same time. So we know, okay, like, the air quality is probably not good.
 
S: Does. Your husband also got migraine since he moved to Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #21]: He's lived in Bakersfield his whole life. So I think he's always suffered from migraines.
 
S: So how do you feel about your husband's health because of the bad air quality.
 
[Participant #21]: I feel he's a guy, so he's kind of like I'll just put through. He doesn't want he. He just takes an ibuprofen where me? I'm like, okay. more than he just kind of works through it.
 
S: So I know your husband has the same symptom like you, and you might feel more compassion. Not with your husband, because you also have the same similar symptom.
So in your workplace, how comfortable are people with discussing about the air concerns.
 
[Participant #21]: Well, we talk about it like, you know, cause sometimes they're like, Oh, I didn't. You know I was gonna go outside for a walk, but I didn't go because of the air, you know, or stuff like that, because the ladies that I work with they're older.
They usually try to avoid. and one of them suffers from really bad asthma, so I know she avoids it the most.
 
S: So can you describe the the general attitude toward the health related to the air at the work.
So when they talk about the air quality issue. Have you experienced, observed any positive or negative attitude that people feel when they talk about this issue?
 
[Participant #21]: It's more negative. Obviously, it's more negative attitude towards it. Because it does. You know, it interferes with how we feel.
 
S: But at the first place, do you think they are willing to share about their feelings about the bad air quality other than heat?
 
[Participant #21]: Well, we just kinda like talk about like oh, like I know one of them should be like, well, I think that's the one she'll be like out.
I'm not. I was gonna go outside, but I didn't go, because, you know, it's so hot and the air is just bad and all they'll start coming in with like allergies and things. So it's just like daily talk of how we feel. Sometimes like I like I have a migraine, or outside. But you know so those are just conversations we have.
 
S: Hmm, okay. So you think that those air quality issues are the one of the main conversation that you're occasionally doing, having with your colleagues.
Since the air quality is bad. Have you ever wanted to take any mask in your office, but felt hesitant, due to the social kind of pressure or concerns.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah, I think, especially because I think we did it so much with Covid that it's kind of like, you know. I think now, if you wear it, they're like, Oh, I wonder if that person sick, or you know, or you know. So it's kind of like you just kind of avoid it. So I think me. I just get in the habit of like I come in my office, and if I don't have any appointments.
just kind of keep my door closed, and you know. But I mean, yeah, I mean we. I think it would be okay to wear a mask. But I think we're so used like we, now the, stigma, I guess if you see it is like, Oh, they're probably. I wonder if they're sick, or you know. And so yeah, I just don't wear one.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: So you mentioned about the stigma. So is it about like people seeing you as a sick people, or like people seeing you as weak people.
 
[Participant #21]: Probably a weak cause they probably feel like you have a weak immune system, or you're very concerned, or you know about your health, or getting something, or cause I mean. We don't. I think I know. I think if I see somebody with a mask I'm like, I do wonder like, are they sick, or you know, or what or do they really have really bad, you know, breathing issues, or you know, that kind of that affects them. And that's why they were.
 
S: like the experiences you had felt hesitant to wear mask. Have you ever felt hesitant to share about the air quality issues, because that people might view you as a weak person.
 
[Participant #21]: I think it's sometimes people might look at it like.
oh, like you're exaggerating. It's not that bad, or if they don't experience it, they might think like, oh, you're just making it up to not engage or say like, I just have a migraine, and you don't want to deal with somebody. or kind of stay away from people, so I think if they don't experience it, they might look at it like.
you know. I think that person is just exaggerated. I don't think it's that bad.
 
S: As a man I feel like when I disclose those things, my fellow male colleagues. They seem like they don't care about the error, quality issue.
But when I talk with female colleagues they are more. you know, willing to listen to me and agree with my opinion. But compared to the male colleagues.
So do you also felt like the same way? Do you think there are some gender differences and talking about the air quality concerns.
 
[Participant #21]: I think. Yeah, I think it is true. I think females are more empathetic, I think, when we have conversations about anything about not feeling good than the guy I mean. I know with my husband I can, because he experienced it. I don't know how. If he talks with his coworkers, if they how they react to it.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: So, aside from yourself, have you ever noticed or observed, like others, avoiding talking about air quality issues or act like it doesn't bother them.
 
[Participant #21]: I think. No, I think there is people that don't really care, I guess, about what if they don't, I think if it doesn't affect them. They kinda don't feel like it's important.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Have you ever witnessed any differences between like male colleagues’ reactions and those of female colleagues? When you talk about the air quality issues or the concerns around them.
 
[Participant #21]: I think on, girls I like, I said. I think they're more empathetic. Males are kind of like, Oh, okay, or they'll be. So there's been like, maybe here and there. Was it like, Oh, yeah, my wife is the same way.
I don't think they feel that it affects males as much, maybe, or unless they just kind of put it off and don't think about it. But, like on, I know, just like at least for my husband I know he knows, like all the air quality gives me bad migraines.
 
S: it would be great if you can hear your husband's opinion if he are willing to join our interview research.
Can you please ask him whether he is interested in this research later.
 
[Participant #21]: I'll ask. He works at Ccb.
 
S: Oh, okay, okay, thank you. So just just let me know. Okay, yeah.
 
[Participant #21]: Oh, that's good!
 
S: So you said there are some time people might hesitant to talk about the air quality issue. But what would need to change for you or them to feel completely comfortable discussing air quality impacts at work.
 
[Participant #21]: I feel like We're losing empathy towards people. I feel like, if people are not experiencing something, it can be like wrong. It's not my problem.
So I think only unless you're experiencing something that affects you or a family member, then you're more empathetic, like, oh, okay, you know, like, I understand, or I understand where you're coming from, or I know somebody. So I think over the years. I think we're in a time of the times we're leaving right now. People are less empathetic when it comes to certain issues. If it doesn't affect them. don't think it matters or data doesn't generally don't care.
 
S: Yeah, you're saying that since they are not aware about the issue, they are less likely to understand the concerns.
Then, how about what would need to change for you? To feel completely comfortable, to wear a mask when we have a very bad air quality in a specific day or time, moment.
 
[Participant #21]: I think we'd be just getting in the habit of doing it, and not, I guess, worry about what people might think. You just put it on, I mean, at the end of the day you're you have to be worried about your safety and your comfort more than what a lot of people are thinking so. I think it would just be getting in the habit of carrying a mask, and then, you know, using it when needed.
 
S: So when you talk about the migraine, I felt like I felt, you know, really connected with you, because there are really rare moment. I could find people who experience migraine people who don't experience migraine actually don't understand my situation. especially my wife, she thought. I'm just faking because I don't want to talk with her.
So sometimes people feel connected with others when facing common challenges, like dealing with error, quality, or symptoms of, you know, migraine because of the air quality. So when you learn that the others share similar environmental concerns, how does that affect you?
 
[Participant #21]: Well, I think, it feels good to know that if people actually, you know, have the sympathy for you, then more than people that don't like, you know, like how you said people might think they're like, oh, that person is just exaggerating. They're faking it. But, like I know, like my mother-in-law. She always checks the weather, and she'll be like, oh, did you see the air she's like, Oh, you know, maybe don't like she'll look ahead and make sure how the air quality is going to be so even like, I think last weekend she saw that the air quality is like, should we go to the beach for the day just to kind of get out or get different air? So I know her. She tries to understand it, even though she doesn't experience it. So I think it's just. There is people that are just going to be empathetic. And I think there's just people that are not.
 
S: So when you feel like the other person around you, does not, you know, really understand your situation like they might think that they might express that your concern about the error quality is comes from your extreme sensitivity on the environmental issue that the other person cannot experience.
In that case, how do you feel actually? Do you feel lonely, or do you feel.
 
[Participant #21]: Well, I think it is a sense of loneliness, because they're not experiencing what you are. So I think at some point you just stop sharing.
You know, you just stop sharing. You're like, well, why you want to talk about it, if you know they don't really don't care. So I mean it does. It is a sense of, I guess, really. Only when somebody doesn't understand or try to understand where you're coming from. So it's kind of like you're dealing with it on your own.
 
S: I think you experience the same thing when I 1st talk about the asthma of my daughter with some of the colleagues. Okay, so have you ever talked about your migraine symptom with your colleagues? And and that is from the air quality issue.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah, I they know so like they already know. Like, if my lights up, they're like, Oh, you know, I have a bad migraine. They already kind of know. So they're kind of like they'll ask like, if, say, we're have they? Hey, do you? This is not an important meeting, so don't feel like you have to come in if you're not feeling good. So they kind of know already. So I mean, I'm glad they're they, you know they care, you know, so I think with them I'm comfortable sharing, you know, and talking about it like, oh, the air quality is bad today. Then they'll be like, Oh, my! One of my should be like, don't go as high then to stay inside, go walk around the library or something. So I mean. I think with them I'm comfortable, because.
 
[Participant #21]: you know, they understand a little bit.
 
S: So it feels like they are carrying.
Have you outside of your work domain, including your health and also your mood?
So do you feel like they're like more than colleagues, like like Ally.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah. And I think because they they go through their own issues. And we try to be empathetic, even though we're not going through the same thing. But we just kind of listen to each other. So it does feel more. And I, you know I've known them at a personal level. So I think obviously, it's more more than just colleagues. It's more like, we say, we're like a little family here, you know, because we understand each other a lot in different ways.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah. Do you think that kind of like connection can influence your feelings like general feelings at the workplace or the way you respond to those colleagues later on.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like, it brings more of a connection, and it makes it where I can talk about it. And it's not gonna be looked at or ignored.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: How about the case with, like others like who seems like understand their situation, but didn't respond strongly.
 
[Participant #21]: Know. I stopped sharing. I just stopped sharing like.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: And does that influence how you feel generally at the workplace and your future behavior with those colleagues?
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah, because it does like, say, if I like, there's times that I've thought about applying to other positions, you know. And you're like, or are they gonna understand like, is it going to be an issue? If I just don't feel like if I'm having a bad day, or are they going to be like, oh, this person just doesn't like to work. So I guess it brings comfort for me to stay where I'm at, because I'm okay here as opposed to like like I do. Do I really want to go somewhere else?
 
S: I think that's a very important point. So as you share your vulnerability from the air quality. your colleagues understand you, and because of that. You feel good about that, and you feel some good connection with them. And actually, that gives you some attitude that you want to listen to their vulnerability.
And those exchange of the vulnerability makes you feel like, you know, small. You know. Family. Another family in your workplace.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah. And it's it gets comfortable. And I think that's why you just kind of get comfortable in your position, because it's kind of like.
I already know what I got. Who I work with. I already know how they are. I know they understand having a bad day. I understand them. If they're having a bad day as opposed to. If you go to a different department, they could be like, oh, that person's lazy, they just don't wanna work, or they exaggerate? Or is is this how they're always gonna be.
 
S: So you can be yourself at your home and also at your work. You don't need to pretend.
 
[Participant #21]: Yeah.
 
S: That's wonderful.
 
S: I'm looking for the follow-up questions. There were a lot of good, you know, perspective we learned from you. So thank you very much. Again.
 
[Participant #21]: You're welcome.
 
S: One more thing.
Have you ever had chance to look for any others have same or similar worries about air quality?
 
[Participant #21]: No, I agree, I think.
No, I think there's been times where you kind of like somebody might say, like, Oh, yeah, like, I get those 2, but I don't get them as bad, but I don't think it's ever got to the conversation of like what causes theirs, so I don't know like, if it causes the same issue like me, where the heart quality makes it worse, or if theirs are just regular migraines.
 
S: Hmm, okay, and let's talk about how your organization support you when you deal with the air quality. So what steps has your organization taken to address air quality issues so like, you know, distributing mask or providing air purifiers or planting trees around our campus or adjusting work schedules. So are there any things your organization provided to you?
 
[Participant #21]: No. I don't think I looked into it either. Like, Hey, I'm like, what can I get from here for.
Yes, interesting back to me. I don't think I've ever.
 
S: Brought it up like that.
So do you have any general thoughts about your organization's inaction regarding the air quality issue?
 
[Participant #21]: I think they sometimes promote that wellness is important. I just don't think they vary it in the many different ways, and how we can seek help without it, looking like we're asking for too much, I guess.
 
S: Hmm, okay, so since your organization does not, you know, actively take actions on improving air quality or supporting their employees to handle the air quality issue. You do not feel any, do you feel any?
Do you feel your organization need to have any change for addressing air quality.
 
[Participant #21]: I think they should address it. I think it should be important, just because it's not important to them doesn't mean it's not important to somebody. and I think they should make it where it's. You feel more comfortable coming to them and saying, Hey! Like I noticed that this? Is there anything that you think I could have a flexible work schedule on days that are bad, or you know. So I think it's just. They don't make us feel like we can just come with those kind of topics. They promote wellness, but they don't say up to how much are they willing to do for us to have wellness.
 
S: Do you have any suggestion to your workplace to make your workplace? Your colleagues, to share more comfortable about the topic of the air quality issues.
 
[Participant #21]: I think they should promote it more just the way we promote everything now they should promote it more, and look into the different types of wellness that, you know is not just mental health, or it's just not, you know.
if you're safe, go to the wellness center. It's more like, you know what other topics are out there, maybe, as suggestions. you know, like, you know, where we can some kind of like a questionnaire like, what are their topics. So that way they start looking into what other, what as employees think or what affects us. And it's not just you know what topics, you know, we wanna help with. So I think that would be a good thing that they could do.
 
S: You said that sometimes people are hesitant to wear a mask because of the social pressure, and sometimes people don't understand fully understand. When you talk about the air quality issue. So, in order to avoid those situations, do you think you're, what kind of things your organization can implement.
 
[Participant #21]: So I think if they take into consideration other people's opinions, and say, Hey, like, you know.
I don't know just the way we have hand sanitizer dispensers have still masks just because it's not covid anymore, like they should still have those available in case you want to wear it while you're at work.: and you know, so I think that would help a lot.
 
S: Hmm, okay, I think last year when I went to one of the events, big events in Csub at that time there were really heavy dust, so I could barely see the building just a few feet away.
When I finally arrive at that event venue. I start a conversation about valley fever. I might caught up the valley fever about because of this dust wind. and some one male colleague said. I don't care about valley fever. People talk about the valley fever, but I never caught for entire life like 40 years. and at that moment I feel like, you know, he doesn't aware about how many people are struggle with the valley fever.
So so have you ever experienced similar experiences like me, like.
 
[Participant #21]: Some people. I think so. So like my dad. My parents worked farm labor picking grapes all their life.
So my dad ended up with valley fever from being out there. So it's I mean, I think, like you said, if you're not going through it, people are kind of like oh, I don't care, or I don't even know if that's true or not. You know, I think it's just something made up.
So I think, unless you're experiencing it, or you actually worry about your health that way. I think people just don't seem it's a topic for them to care about.
 
S: But in order to increase the awareness, we cannot make them to experience valley fever or asthma. But what kind of training or kind of you know campaign your organization can do to increase the awareness of how many people really struggle with the air quality in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #21]: I think it just sometimes they bring like say, they're having a wellness day here, and they're having guest speakers come and talk about mental health and other and stuff like that. Or, you know, suicide and stuff like they just stuff that goes on with students. I mean, I think they should still bring. Maybe people they're experiencing valley fever. How it affected them, or you know, even people that look into those steps will like the climate and stuff to give. Give us awareness of what goes on. So I think if people hear it more, maybe they'll be like, oh, I didn't know that, or you know, but if they don't promote it.
people are kind of like, out of mind, out of sight.
 
S: Okay, so you're saying that we need to consider the air quality issue as the with the same importance that people think about the suicide issue, or gender or minority issue.
 
[Participant #21]: Yes.
 
S: Okay, and let's talk about the future perspectives and your future goal.
So, considering the current air quality issues, do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area. Long term.
 
[Participant #21]: I think so. Just because my husband has his family here. I have my family in Palm Springs. So I think we're mostly just gonna stay here. So it's just kinda
I guess it's something you just have to get used to and find better ways to feel good about yourself. Feel good when you're having those, when we have those bad days.
But yeah, I think permanently, we're staying here. So.
 
S: Okay. So the main reason you want to stay here is your family.
Okay, since you have a family here. you will have more motivation to change the environment here, to make your family live in a better place. So what changes would make you feel more optimistic about living and working here in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #21]: I guess, at least start with my family and make it a more of a conversation, and find out if they're feeling the same way I feel. And you know, making more like, okay, we should start wearing masks. So we don't feel sick, and then maybe actually start doing something about it here at my job. I guess that could. It could be a topic now to say, like, Hey, have you guys looked into this like, you know. Maybe they could. I could ask somebody to. Can you guys do a survey? See how many other students feel that way? Maybe it affects our students, and I have never thought about that either.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: What comes to my mind is like being authentic at work is really matter right? And you know I want to be myself at work, and I think it's really important that my core are also seeing like. View me for who I am, and like you said, when you shared your concerns about something like air quality having core respond with empathy and understanding, felt really meaningful. Right?
So my question is like. you know, among all the different factors that shape you to be yourself at work. How important do you think your coworkers reaction to your concerns around air quality.
 
[Participant #21]: I think, if I make them more aware of the issues, maybe they make it more aware to their families, and it kind of spreads, you know. if we make it a topic of, you know, showing empathy, since we, since we already share empathy for each other, maybe having more conversations, where they kind of go outside to their homes, and then they find out if they have family and just kind of spreading it so that way. Everybody kind of does feel comfortable wherever they're at. If they have health issues or not, health issues or just be empathetic. If people do have issues.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's thoughtful. And my one last question is, do you have any your personal ways or strategy to deal with? The air quality issues, not just wearing a mask, or checking the weather, or rescheduling or adjusting your current schedules. Do you have any good strategy to share.
 
[Participant #21]: No, I don't. I would. I guess I would have to look into. See what what would be good, you know, to start implementing 1st in myself and then around me.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thank you for sharing.
 
S: And this is the last questions, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with air, quality and connections with your colleagues in your workplace that we haven't discussed.
 
[Participant #21]: No, that's it.
