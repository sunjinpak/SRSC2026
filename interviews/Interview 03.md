[P3]: Once in the warehouse I check in with the team.
[P3]: Then I give you the schedule and address. My immediate concern.
[P3]: Yeah, so, and most of my daily work includes managing workflows.

[P3]: I catch up on reading. And I also watch a movie. I love watching movies.
[P3]: I still love reading books. Yeah. And my evenings are quite quiet, focused on relaxing because, I'm trying to just recover after the strenuous work
[P3]: which I've done in the beginning.
J: Okay.
J: And then section 2. So we're moving right along here for your personal background, as it pertains to your family and living situation. Could you tell me a bit about your family, and who you live with?

[P3]: Yeah.
J: Okay? And then, as far as your connection to the San Joaquin Valley.
J: how long have you lived in the San Joaquin Valley? And what brought you here?
[P3]: I've lived here for about 15 years, 15 15 years
[P3]: and I moved here in for work. Opportunity.
[P3]: Because when I go to my clients walk me.
[P3]: and the cost of living was actually more affordable compared to where I grew up.
[P3]: Yeah. And the location made. It's easier to settle down and start a family. So over time.
[P3]: I've developed a connection to the area.
[P3]: especially my job and relationship due to
[P3]: yeah. But the air quality has always been a concern.
J: Okay. And that's moving right along into Section 3 about the environmental experiences and perceptions. So
J: regarding your thoughts on the air quality, how do you feel about the air quality in the San Joaquin Valley?
[P3]: About the air quality I feel. It's something I've been trying to.
[P3]: It's it's a concern for me, and it's actually one of the things I notice when I step outside
[P3]: we started doing the white fire season or days with high pollution level
[P3]: attempt to smoke, and the ease can be discouraging.
[P3]: and my attack is used like the A is not as clean
[P3]: as I feel we should be clean for a Ld lifestyle.
[P3]: Yeah.
J: Okay. And as far as your impact on your daily life, in what ways does the air quality affect your daily life at work and at home?
[P3]: at work. It's essentially affects both my work and home life. At work. We avoid people. Lock those looking for to lunch?
[P3]: Because the outdoor air can cause discomfort for employees
[P3]: and also impact our indoor air conditions
[P3]: and on some bad days, some bad days, I notice more fatigue. Yeah, I feel fatigue. Sometimes I have some nude, respiratory irritation.
[P3]: Yeah. And at home this same air quality actually depends on how much air will be spread outdoors. So if the air is poor, we limit outdoor activities like walking the dog or playing the yard with kids. And I feel this frustrating because it restricts most of our family time. Yeah, to enjoy the outdoor, enjoy the
[P3]: the presence of Mitchell.
[P3]: Yeah.
J: Hmm, okay, so yeah, you kind of touched on the next question about the
J: impact on daily life. But so for observations of impact on others
J: Like your friends, roommates or coworkers. Have you noticed impact on others around you? Anybody? You know your your wife, your kids?
[P3]: Sure, of course. I've noticed this.
[P3]: my coworkers. They sometimes complain about the air quality.
[P3]: especially with those that are the work rules that require them to stay
[P3]: more out time outside. Yeah. And we talk about feeling tired and having addicts on bad days. Yeah. And I also worry about air quality. It might also affect my sugars health.
[P3]: because they put out seasonal allergies that seem to worsen during times of poor air quality.
[P3]: Yeah. And sometimes I feel like I might not need long term
[P3]: in the area, because I think this is the best option for them.
[P3]: And actually my spouse and I disclosed it several times.
[P3]: And we actually appreciate the opportunity we actually see from you. Both. Developmental factor, yeah, is.
[P3]: it's it's a good determinant for us.
J: Yeah.
J: absolutely. Okay. So regarding that your family, how do concerns about your family's health influence your feelings?
[P3]: How do you see?
J: How do you? How do concerns about your family's health, influence your feelings?
[P3]: Yeah, like, I said, we said, Yeah,
[P3]: we actually worry about Poor air, air quality.
[P3]: It's actually been to.
[P3]: because I know this poor air quality. I have long term healthy fit
[P3]: on children, and this actually makes me feel a dizzy and sometimes guilty for example, my kids at times experience asthma like symptoms during times of heavy pollution or Wi-fi smoke.
[P3]: which is, I mean, yeah. And you have had to like, adjust our routine.
[P3]: So we have to keep them indoors doing bad Eds.
[P3]: Yeah, so. And at times I I used to question myself. Maybe we should move to somewhere. Very nice. Yeah.
J: Yeah, okay, so as far as the community connection and identity.
J: And shared challenges. Do you think experiencing air pollution with others strengthens your sense of connectedness in your organization?
[P3]: of course. Experiencing pollution with others actually strengthens my sense of connection with my community and organizations. Because I remember an instance
[P3]: doing wide wildlife season wildfire season, my workers and I.
[P3]: We often discuss how smoke is actually affecting our routines and fields
[P3]: and these combinations actually tend to bring us together.
[P3]: Like a sense of solidarity. So
[P3]: as far we're all trying to navigate same challenges with workplace. So with my family and friends, we've talked about strategies to cook
[P3]: like, I'm using air purifiers also. So we do share
[P3]: and mutual understanding and supports
[P3]: because we are because we are all facing a common problem that affect our liability.
J: Right. And how would you say you feel when others share similar experiences with you related to air pollution?
[P3]: When others share their experiences with air pollution. I feel affected knowing that I'm not alone
[P3]: in dealing with these challenges because it creates
[P3]: empathy. Yeah, so, and it makes me to understand that I'm not the one going through this. And I can still manage the situation.
[P3]: Yeah. For example. I had a coworker.
[P3]: Talk about their child struggle with asthma actually reminds me that we are trying to protect our family in similar ways.
[P3]: Yeah.
J: Oh, wow! Okay, alright. So for the next section, identity Fusion.
J: Sometimes people feel a strong bond with others when facing common challenges, like dealing with air quality. How did you feel when you shared experiences about air quality with your colleagues?
[P3]: knowing that we we all dealing with same environmental challenges. I just feel
[P3]: it's not just about getting through the workday. I just feel we just have to like support each other as people who share the same struggle
[P3]: and keyboard outcomes. Yeah.
J: Gotcha. Okay. So as far as the influence on your thoughts and behaviors, how has this sense of bond affected your thoughts, feelings, or actions towards your organization?
[P3]: It works.
J: Mhm.
[P3]: Is the next question. For this I feel my influence of thoughts and behaviors has actually led me to.
[P3]: They'll be willing to advocate for what this initiative that really address equality issues.
[P3]: So for example, I've actually suggested providing Max for outdoor tags.
[P3]: and it also made me more mindful of how I can contribute
[P3]: to a supportive environment for my team, like I'm checking in with the coworkers
[P3]: that same particular very affected with the air quality that I tend to talk to them, and just try to encourage them like, give them air purifiers that are provided by the company.
J: Okay. And so as far as personal vulnerability, these questions are all kind of similar. So
J: it's but it's important to kind of get the whole picture. So the next question is, how have er sorry? Have you ever shared personal or family vulnerabilities related to air quality with your colleagues at work? And if so, how is it received? And how did it affect your connection with them?
[P3]: Sure, of course. I've shared personal conversations and concerns about my family health with a few colleagues, especially during the wi-fi season
[P3]: and these conversations they met with understanding and kindness. For instance, one coworker shared their own struggles with their child's asthma, and we exchanged tips on managing symptoms.
[P3]: and a few you these openness. I've actually straightened my connection with them
[P3]: because it feels like we are building a support network something like that, even even though we are just coworkers.
J: Okay. And so moving on to the next section titled Personal and Collective Actions.
J: What actions, if any, have you taken to deal with the challenges of air quality?
[P3]: For this. I've tried
[P3]: some on ways. So on a personal level.
[P3]: I've taken several steps to cope with everybody's challenges.
[P3]: We use air pump fires and kingdoms.
[P3]: And we actually monitor our air policy levels daily
[P3]: and and also try to limit outdoor activities on poor ladies.
J: Gotcha.
[P3]: So I try to make sure. My kids. They wear masks when necessary, and I follow up with the doctor. If I feel sit on worse and at work. After wearing the mask, when I have to spend
[P3]: more coyotes in the locking dog area.
[P3]: and my coworker and I, we do share tips.
[P3]: Yeah, like, base quality apps to track conditions. And so, yeah, and.
J: So even use the air quality apps?
[P3]: Yeah.
J: Oh, okay, wow! That's great. So it seems like you've taken a lot of actions. Then.
J: Just a follow up question, how do those around you cope with bad air quality? I know that you've been talking about your coworker that you work with. But how do they? How does
J: he or she and anyone else around you cope with the bad air quality?
[P3]: I just feel we do take similar precautions.
[P3]: Amplifiers are to maintain those green bricks.
[P3]: Yeah. And even, in fact, some haven't spoken to me about moving their families out of the area due to persistent health concerns.
[P3]: Yeah. So. And some they try to stay hydrated. And why some use this, I suppose, to reduce the irritation.
J: Okay?
J: And so, as far as your organizational efforts go, how is your organization helping employees to overcome the air quality issues?
[P3]: They've actually tried they've tried to help us address this issue.
[P3]: They provide our masks, and they opus update our Hvac system in the warehouse. And yeah, and and doing wildfire season.
[P3]: They try to be a little bit flexible and allow us to work shorter sheets or take time off if needed. But I feel there's just there's still room for improvements. Yeah. And I and I feel they provide better communication about equality risk.
[P3]: And they should implement more measures like offering a purifiers. Yeah, for employees to reach out to.
[P3]: Yeah.
J: Okay, and so what do you? So it sounds like, they do pretty well, what do you think about your organization's actions?
[P3]: I I actually appreciate the steps my, my organization that are actually taking. But I think they could do more to show they are actually invested in employees. Well, being.
[P3]: yeah, because of why the Max and Hvc updates, they are quite upset.
[P3]: There's a feeling that these efforts are reactive.
[P3]: So they might have some reactions
[P3]: rather than being a long term strategy. So I feel they could actually do better.
[P3]: Yeah.
J: Okay. And so the impact, as far as the impact of actions on your perspectives has support from your organization, changed your perspective on air quality issues at all?
[P3]: I just feel the support from my organizations have made people aware of the
[P3]: and the same environmental issues. So it has actually shown me that even small actions
[P3]: like providing resources and adjusted policies, can't make
[P3]: The difference in how employees experience equality challenges.
J: Okay, and does support from your organization strengthen your connection to the organization?
[P3]: I feel it has made me so. What predicted? Because at least it shows some kind of acknowledgement
[P3]: in about the issue. Yeah, and I. So when I see the management of the trying to take steps to address equality, it gives me sense that they care about us as individuals.
[P3]: so I feel I'll feel connected if they took a more comprehensive approach.
[P3]: Exactly to tackling the issues more.
J: Okay and moving right along to the next section regarding future perspectives and aspirations and long term plans. Do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area long term? Why or why not?
[P3]: For this, to be honest. I'm quite uncertain about staying
[P3]: in South Way Valley a long time, because I where I value the job opportunity
[P3]: and the community connections are virtually beauty.
[P3]: the persistence, air policy issues we have in the organization.
[P3]: and if the situation does not improve, I may consider getting to an area with better environmental conditions. Especially for my children's elder and future.
[P3]: So yeah, or do moving out was only starting over right?
[P3]: Sure. Yeah, because I have to start from beginning. Try to look for the new school. A new job. Yeah, everything. But I feel it's just for the best.
J: Okay? And as far as hopes for environmental improvement, imagine the air quality significantly improved. How do you think that would affect your life and your connection to the community?
[P3]: Wow! That would really enhance the quality of life, and I'll feel more comfortable. Spending time outdoors with my family.
[P3]: especially engaging in sports, and probably it.
[P3]: Yeah. And also it will make me feel more positive about losing. I'm scheduling this kind of area.
[P3]: I will give you my question to the community.
[P3]: Yeah. So I'll be able to at least be comfortable describing when I where I do live. Yeah, because I know where I stay actually offers a better health condition. So I just feel, yeah, if you just improve, it will make life more easier for families and workers.
[P3]: Yeah.
J: Right. Okay? And as far as desired support. So what potential factors can make people leave the San Joaquin Valley, for example, lack of advice from friends, personal efforts?
J: So what? Yeah, what? What potential factors can make people leave?
J: Would you say?
[P3]: From my point of view.
[P3]: a few factors that can make people leave, and probably if the government, local government.
[P3]: they fail to implement effective air quality improvement.
[P3]: It's going to push people to leave the environment. Yeah. And I feel if better opportunities job opportunities arise in areas with
[P3]: who might use to pursue a balance, a better balance between their work and and built.
[P3]: And if families are and workers, they are being exposed. I will talk about myself
[P3]: if you, if you have been exposed to poor air, to poor air quality for you.
[P3]: Bit of time. Yeah, I was actually
[P3]: give to seek and other environment. Yeah, sure.
J: Right. Okay. And so
J: the opposite of that question, what potential factors can make people stay in the San Joaquin Valley?
[P3]: Yeah, sure. I feel if we can have a good air quality can reduce the pollution. Yeah.
[P3]: I feel people to encourage people to bring in the region. Yeah. And I feel if gas shoots the government.
[P3]: they can offer wellness, initiatives.
[P3]: air quality resources and policies. Yeah, I feel to make us feel valued and supported and will make us able to stay. Yeah. And I just feel, and also if they can also be affordable living conditions. Yeah.
[P3]: with steady job opportunities, with balanced equality. I feel we can actually like maybe to to
[P3]: to stay. I won't want to leave, because I feel
[P3]: most of the reasons why people do this is
[P3]: just because of the health hazard some people they have different mites meet, and some people they have different opinions about diseases, and so few it might cause drastic drastic
[P3]: effect to their body system. So I feel most people are particularly concerned about their health. So if if they can be able to have policies that can help
[P3]: please increase to to reduce the pollution and improve air quality. A few people will want to stay.
J: Okay, alrighty.
J: So as far as the closing questions and additional thoughts, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with the air quality and community connections in the San Joaquin Valley that we haven't discussed so far?
[P3]: Actually my dream to stay
[P3]: or leave. This value will actually depend heavily on whether
[P3]: new progress is made in addressing
[P3]: the affiliator challenges here, particularly the air quality.
[P3]: Yeah, because I feel this valley has a lot to offer from affordable housing to central location for work and location. But the air quality has been a state issue for me and my family. That was why I won't signed up for this study, and I feel if the air quality improves, whether through stricter regulations
[P3]: or more good initiatives or technical innovations.
[P3]: I I just feel I'll feel more confident in using my kids here?
[P3]: Yeah, because I feel, are you with me?
J: Yeah, I'm here.
[P3]: But I feel a cleaner environment will not only improve our physical health, but also enhance our overall quality of life, so it will actually make me feel
[P3]: like this year is a positive choice for the future
[P3]: rather than the compromise. Yeah. And also I feel, another factor that would make mistake is if the community and businesses in the area
[P3]: they come together to address these issues. Let's say, if local organizations
[P3]: like my workplace. We can offer more robust support.
[P3]: like health programs, workplace safety measures or partnerships with government organizations. It will strengthen my connection to the region.
[P3]: Yeah, and knowing that people are trying to
[P3]: work together to solve the problem.
[P3]: to give me more open in the future.
[P3]: Yeah. So I want to just feel like I'm living in a area that values with economic development and also family. Else because I feel family health is a priority. And I want a kind of environment where everybody can work towards a better future for everybody.
[P3]: Yeah. And if this effort actually
[P3]: so, since I'm not happy to consume living here, yeah.
J: Okay. Alright, [P3], I think you answered everything pretty well.
J: That should be it, so that's all we needed from you, as far as your answers and everything.
J: And you should be getting your Amazon gift card in the email, maybe not more than 48 h from now. So yeah, I appreciate your time. Thanks for having the interview man.
[P3]: Yeah. And you, too. Do have a good day bye.
J: Have a good one, man. Go ahead. You can leave the zoom call now.
