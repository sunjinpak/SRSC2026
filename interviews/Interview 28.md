## Transcript
S: We complete the interview, we will
S: review the transcription of the interview, and after that we will delete all the recording and also replace all the terminology or the word that we can or other can identify your identification.
P28: Okay. Okay.
S: Okay, so
S: After this interview we will send you $40 Amazon gift card.
P28: Oh, okay.
S: And it would be great if you can share any personnel who's also concerned with the air quality.
P28: Okay.
S: Okay? And so can you briefly tell us about your current role in your job?
P28: Yeah. So my current role, I'm a professor with tenure in the [Name of the company]. But in the last year my role, which just ended, was chief of staff to the President.
S: And since you have moved to other area from Kern county, can you please
S: walk us through, how was your day when you work at CSUB?
P28: Yeah, so it it was. So I lived off of
P28: Oh, my gosh.
P28: If you went up there's [Road name in Bakersfield]. What's the next one?
P28: It's the big.
P28: So there's old [Road name in Bakersfield]. Here's the [Road name in Bakersfield].
P28: and then you would go to the [Road name in Bakersfield] and turn left, and there was a gym. Do you know what that big road is? It goes down to like [Store name].
S: [Road name in Bakersfield]e.
P28: Without [Road name in Bakersfield] it intersects with [Road name in Bakersfield].
P28: It's not.
P28: Another way.
S: [Road name in Bakersfield].
P28: Yeah, [Road name in Bakersfield]. So I lived just up a little bit beyond Stockdale High School, so I would come down [Road name in Bakersfield] to go to CSUB, but and I was in a development, and when I would drive out there was an open field. I can't remember the main road that crossed, but there was an open field, and there were oil derricks in there.
P28: And I hated seeing that every I hated driving out and seeing that.
P28: But that was right in my face, the air quality because of the oil. It was a big, it's a big open. I don't know if you know where that is a big open patch, and sometimes it's grassy, and one time it seemed like they dropped down from outer space for about a thousand sheep
P28: to mow the grass, and I thought, Oh, they're eating that grass, but I mean, I guess the derek was down there, but on the days where it was really polluted, when I would drive out of that neighborhood, I would drive out and then turn right, and then the next was [Road name in Bakersfield]. But I would see that pumping derek. And so it was really, I think
P28: really just right in my face to see that. So
P28: Oh.
P28: so I think that's how I would start my day. Every morning when I would leave, I would see that.
P28: and then I go to the coffee bean and get a coffee, which I miss because it was a driving, and and then I would come in, but you could see, you know you could see the sky that it was gray
P28: and sometimes when I would walk to our building on the campus, and if you could look down past the library you could see the three flags.
P28: And I took a picture once and sent it to a friend, and I said, Look, it's a sunny day, but you can't see it because of the air pollution.
S: Hmm.
P28: So I I constantly I mean, I was aware you know, of. I mean, I could physically see the pollution, but I would think it made me hyper aware to see that pumping derek every morning when I would leave. So that's how I would start my day.
S: So after your work, do you have a do you? Walk outside of your house, or, do you normally.
S: no,
P28: Yeah. So I well, I would. There is a gym
P28: where the, there's a [name of shop] at [name of a place], and
P28: Ming in that little shopping center, so I would go to that gym, but I would walk my dog
P28: to the park that was behind. I I would walk him there 4 days a week on that big walk that start
P28: from the main entrance. I didn't park there. From the CSUB I would park around California pizza kitchen, and then I would walk down nice to Park, and then I would do the big loop and walk back and walk, and I would do that three or four days a week, and then other times I would walk him in the neighborhood, and I'd sit outside.
S: Hmm, okay.
P28: And I you could. So I mean, you know
P28: I like I mean, I like the nice weather, but I mean you're sitting out in the dirty air.
S: So some people might hesitant to walk outside because they're sensitive to the bad air quality, and also some people have asthma, but it seems like you don't have those kind of issue with your health.
P28: Yeah, so I had asthma as a child
P28: and I have terrible sinuses. So I take this stuff at Walgreens, Well Fed Sinus and Allergy, over the counter, and I probably took a little too much there. So, but I've always had kind of those issues, but I didn't have any asthma attacks or anything, but sometimes I could feel it in my because I did have asthma as a child.
S: Hmm, okay. So you move from Phoenix to Bakersfield?
P28: I moved from Georgia.
S: I was getting.
P28: Yeah, I was at [name of previous workplace].
P28: And that was about an hour 45 min outside of Savannah, and an hour from the beach, and that was in rural Georgia
P28: and that is a very clean air. I was from Phoenix to Georgia, and I mean it was, it was sunny and you know the sky was blue. You, it was never that, you never saw that pollution haze.
S: Oh!
P28: Ever
P28: and I could tell the difference from moving from Phoenix to there in my breathing, plus, you know, I went to the beach a lot because it was close. You go for a day, you know. It was only like 50 minutes. I missed that. And so that air was really really clean.
P28: Atlanta is just two hours north of Florida, so it's warm and so so that
P28: so I think. And then I moved from that to Bakersfield, and that was a shock.
S: Hmm.
P28: Because I it was I was back in all of that pollution again.
S: So during the job talk,
S: did anybody told you about the air quality.
P28: Nope.
S: How about valley fever?
P28: No!
P28: Did they tell you?
S: No.
S: It was like March when the air quality is best.
P28: Yeah, I came in March, and it had rained, and it was. It had rain, too. It was kind of chilly, and it was fine.
S: Oh!
P28: I don't know.
S: So how did you felt like toward your colleague that you know you? So you suddenly realized that you know the Bakersfield air quality? Is not that good than you expected.
P28: You know I didn't really hold it against them, because let's face it. [Name of colleague] from India. They have terrible air quality.
P28: and
P28: [Name of colleague] is from China. I've been to China. They have terrible air quality, so it probably didn't phase them.
P28: Much, and that's mainly who I, [Name of colleague], is from Bakersfield, you know, so probably for them they probably who knows? For [Name of colleague] and [Name of colleague]. But it's probably better air quality. Probably we know and but I didn't. But a lot of my friends were like, you're gonna move to Bakersfield that air. The air quality is terrible.
P28: And so I was like, well, you know, I lived in Phoenix. It's terrible there, too. But one thing I found that depressed me. I think
P28: I'll I don't know if depressed, the right word, but if you would go over to the Costco or towards downtown on the highway, and you would see all those big refineries.
P28: And I hated seeing that and
S: So am I, so am.
P28: And yeah, yeah, and like, I mentioned that, derek, you know. So it was like, right in your face you couldn't that this is, you know that that was causing the pollution, you know. But, oddly enough, here.
P28: I think, sort of the crumbling, but not in shady sides, is fancy, but in. There's a lot of post
P28: industrial age crumbling architecture here.
S: Hmm.
P28: And the sky is gray, so I don't like that either. I mean, you can like feel these like from the oil and gas there, and like the post-industrial age, you can sort of see these remnants of, you know.
P28: bad quality of life right in your face. I mean, there's a lot of nice things in Bakersfield, and there's nice big parking lots which I miss and but I, ummm
P28: yeah.
P28: But I think so. I've always had sinus issues and asthma. But it was a big change, because I had been in clean air for eight years. Really
P28: clean air.
S: So it seems like your medication. The amount of the medication has been increased since you moved to Bakersfield.
P28: Well, not really because I'm allergic to pine trees. And so I was in the pine capital of Georgia, and it's like kind of funny and so it was all about the same. Yeah.
S: Pittsburgh also have lots of.
P28: Oh!
S: Source of the allergy. Yeah.
P28: Yeah, yeah.
S: So I take lots of medication, because I'm the runner.
P28: Oh, yeah. Okay, so, yeah.
S: Okay.
S: So I know you also feel, the concern about the air quality. It would be great if we became friend. If you're here.
P28: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
S: We have lots of commonality, I realize.
P28: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Yeah.
S: But I was also busy, and you're also busy because we are quite new to this organization.
P28: Right right right right. Well, I did ask [Name of colleague] if I could come back, but because of the budget, she said, If I'd had a leave of absence. I couldn't come back, but.
S: I don't know.
P28: Cause. I came because I thought you know this was a opportunity you couldn't refuse, but.
S: Yeah. But if you have connection, then I, I believe you'll, have a spot in 2 or 3 years. So.
P28: Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
S: So how comfortable your were you to share about the air quality concerns with your colleagues
S: in the University?
P28: You know I don't talk about so much with [Name of colleague], I did, because we were looking at the community benefit work, and we would talk about it, but I talked about it with community members, because one of my former students, [Name of former student], he graduated with his MPA in the fall of 2023, and he's with a large nonprofit,
P28: the homeless and other things called the [non-profit name]. He runs the homeless services, but he started the [non-profit name].
P28: [non-profit name].
P28: And I'm not LGBTQ. But I have a lot of experience with nonprofit organizations. That's my area. So he asked if I could help with their bylaws, and I wound up helping them and consulting
P28: pro bono to help them set up their Chamber of Commerce which they did, which it was a pretty joyful experience, working with all of those folks, and there it was. They weren't all LGBTQ. There were parents there, but [Name of colleague], that's how I met her.
S: Hmm.
P28: And she has a child who's LGBTQ. And that's how she was involved. But she's very involved in environmental justice and talking about the air quality, and so I would talk with her about that. And then he's now moved on to the assistant city manager, [Name of person].
P28: Oh, my gosh, [Name of person], that's terrible. I'm going blank.
P28: Oh, hold on.
P28: [Name of person]! I texted him the other day I went blank. Anyway. He actually
P28: he was friends with a friend of mine at [name of previous workplace] though. There's the CCMA, which is the City County Management Association and [Name of colleague] and I and he started a chapter at CSUB, and so we were. The city. People came to speak in the spring of 2024. So he was head of putting together. When [Name of person] had asked all the city
P28: to put together an environmental quality plan as the assistant City manager. He tried to put that together in Bakersfield, and they could not put a plan together.
S: Hmm! Why?
P28: He'd be a good person for you to interview. He's in Las Cruces now and New Mexico, but so they could not put a plan together, but they, when they came to speak the city, they talked about that grant that I sent to you from the State of California, and they talked a lot about the air quality. So I I didn't really so much speak. And then I went to the Cirque day.
P28: and then, you know. We talked about it with the launch Livermore folks, but I wound up talking more about air quality with community people than I did on campus with colleagues.
S: Okay. The reason why I asked this question is as a newcomers from other region. If you say bad things about our town in Bakersfield, it might provide some indicator or signal that you are not satisfied with this region, and you might.
P28: I complained about the air quality.
S: And that will not give a good impression to other colleagues. So do you have any kind of some kind of pressure hesitant to share about your concerns with others?
P28: No no! - but I I mean like I said. I sent a picture of those flags flying with the dirty air to a couple of friends of mine. I'm like, look at this terrible air quality.
P28: And so and they were all like, didn't you, my one friend? He's a [name of previous workplace], he said. Didn't you think about that? And I said, No, he goes, how did you not know that it's one of the most polluted cities in the United States! I said. I don't know. I didn't even I didn't even, I said I didn't really think about it.
S: So when you talk about the concerns about the air quality issue, maybe. With your colleagues?
S: How did they responded to you?
S: Did they also share the same.
P28: Get out if you can't breathe, get out.
P28: Yeah. And so
P28: But you know, like I said, I lived.
P28: I you know I, you know, felt like I had some,
P28: and I don't know. I mean, I've lived in Phoenix, pretty polluted. So it's not as polluted as Bakersfield, so I don't.
P28: Yeah, I don't. I didn't. That was dumb not to look into that. But
P28: I I didn't feel angry with my colleagues. I kind of felt a little angry at myself for not checking into that.
P28: To be honest. Yeah.
S: But when people face the same challenges, like, you know, in Louisiana or Florida, when they face Hurricane Katrina, which affect all the people, rich or poor, it affected all people, and it same challenges may make people
S: stand on the same page. So do you feel like some kind of connection if you talk about or complain about the common issue like common challenges, such as air quality when you talk about that with your colleagues?
P28: Yeah. So I think like I said, when I went to that seminar here that was put on about air quality in Pittsburgh and mainly in the Mon Valley. I talked about Bakersfield, and when that gentleman, who is the executive director of that organization, [name of organization], I raised my hand and said I was in Bakersfield, and I talked about that incident where people were at loggerheads.
P28: because I was so impressed by his comment. We need to come together
P28: and so I think I think the common pages, you know you rather than choosing a side.
P28: I feel that if anyone that I have commonality with, if it would be on air quality or any type of environmental issue, is to not wag the finger at the polluters, so to speak.
P28: that we have to in order to move forward. We have to find a common ground. And so I like that idea. I mean, that's what I had said. [Name of colleague] and I were working on or wanted to do with the lab, I mean, how do you bring people together and and find common ground? So I think
P28: with colleagues. I, the conversations I've had are about, how do you find common ground.
S: Hmm.
S: So it seems like you have built some connection with the community when you meet with person who understand your concerns and also aim for the to overcome for the same challenges. But have you ever felt isolated when you talk about air quality concerns, like, you know.
S: it could be like some kind of feeling that your concerns might be dismissed as overreacting or being.
P28: Sensitive to.
P28: No, I really didn't talk about air quality concerns until I moved to Bakersfield, and I wasn't really an issue on my radar, and it should have been like when I lived in Phoenix you would drive in, and you could see the ring of pollution.
P28: and I have lots of friends in Los Angeles, and I would go down there, and, you know, go over the mountain and come in, and you could see the ring of pollution there, and I went to a conference in the fall. It was in Downtown LA, and I sent to another picture to a friend from. There was a back up on the highway, and I sent a picture, and I said, Here's downtown, LA! Look at the terrible look at the pollution!
P28: So I was constantly sending pictures to people of the air, but I've never done that before.
S: Hmm.
P28: But years ago I did make a post on Facebook about the air quality in Phoenix. But it wasn't,
P28: but it wasn't really a big issue on my radar until I came there because it just you could see it. And then you would look on your the air quality report on your phone and the numbers would be crazy. And I think because you know, when it's hot and dusty, too. And I got 167 stay inside. I didn't necessarily follow those reports. But I
P28: So I think Bakersfield brought brought that out, so I would say, no, I didn't feel isolated. I felt that I was part of the made me want to get involved in the conversation.
S: Hmm, okay, and next
S: it's I would like to talk about how our organization provide some support for you to overcome what the air quality challenges. So I remember that in some day, when when is really strong.
S: Does this everywhere. And actually, our visibility is really poor.
P28: Right, right.
S: On that day. Have you ever thought about canceling your class?
S: or make or ask students to, you know, stay at home or change the format to, you know, zoom session.
P28: No.
P28: and I think partly. That's from being in Phoenix, too, because there's a lot of dust and dusty areas and the air quality. So. No, I never, never.
S: That's my mind.
S: Okay, okay, how about
S: How about when there's a bad air quality, and you feel like you want to take mask. Have you ever felt hesitant to take your mask on your face?
P28: I never put a mask on for air quality. But I've been in Beijing where people put masks on for air quality.
P28: And so no, I never did that.
S: Okay.
P28: Yeah.
S: Were there any particular reason why you haven't tried to take.
P28: Just didn't think about it.
S: Okay. Maybe I'm I'm Asian and South Korean and Japanese.
P28: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I know. Yeah, yeah.
S: Okay.
S: all right. So let's talk about the long term plans. So what changes in Bakersfield would make you feel more optimistic about living there and working there in long term.
P28: So I don't think in the long term now, especially with the change in administration. I think California is
P28: better poised than many places because of the commitment to the environment which I know he's backed down a little bit from Newsome, but I think, given the industries in Bakersfield, and I think that you know this man [Name of an individual] from the [Name of a Lab]. He said that all of the big energy companies like Arrow, which I know combined with someone else, and others that they understood that they had to move to more clean technology. But that they understood that that change was happening. But I think when you
P28: think about the workers, and I think it's back to that issue is, we would rather you're taking away our way of life. And so I think, with the way this
P28: administration is prop fossil fuel, I don't see anything changing in Bakersfield.
S: Hmm.
P28: For at least you know the duration of this administration, and I think that there will be a lot of loggerheads, and I don't
P28: think that because of the air quality issues, I think they'll increase. They'll continue to worsen.
S: Hmm, okay. Okay. I think I have consumed all time.
P28: Okay.
S: I have which I was planned for 45 minutes.
P28: Right.
S: So for the last questions. Do you have any suggestion that I can give to the future interviewee that I can do? You have any suggestion for kind of potential questions I can give to my potential interviewee.
P28: No, I like your questions. I think your questions are good, but the one question that
P28: I I think, based on my answers is, I sound like, I don't really care about the air quality, but I would say, and I don't know how you can ask this, or I guess, what is your knowledge of air quality. And because I think, even though I know that air quality is bad, and I've lived in bad air quality. I mean I I really remained ignorant of.
P28: You know that as a quality of life aspect. So I like that. You're asking those questions. The one thing that I did, and I read I might have been in the Guardian because it. I love the Guardian. It's free, and they're all
P28: to try to put their paywall, and I just ignored. But there was a story about. I think it was in the Guardian. It was somewhere I googled air quality in Bakersfield and I read a story, and I haven't get the LA Times still online, and I don't think it was in there. Maybe it was. I'll try to find it. But it's it was not surprising because of how I felt, but it talked about the percentage of people in Bakersfield with asthma. How many people would get it.
P28: And it was like 90%.
P28: And that was really shocking to me. But I think because I've had asthma, and I've lived in polluted cities.
P28: I would say I became indifferent.
S: Hmm.
P28: To the air quality.
P28: and that in a way made me ignorant of the realities. But when I was there, because I was at that community meeting in September of 2023, and it was so vitriolic
P28: it made me hyperaware.
P28: And so it made me interested in doing something about it, when I had never really been
P28: thinking that I, as a single person that could do anything, and that so I would say,
P28: you know, I don't know a knowledge question. Or have you looked further into air quality and any kind of you know media or print? And has that moved you along? But I think it was just sort of everyone talking about it. I mean, you know, in the different parts of the university, studying it,
P28: seeing it like you can really see it there and then, you know, going to that meeting. So I I would, I think the awareness or you do ask some awareness questions, but it may be asked if anything awareness from the news media or public meetings, or something like that, because that's what activated me.
S: Okay.
P28: That public meeting.
S: And you talk about the awareness. And also I think it could be connected with the sensitivity. And around 80% of my interviewee, they are taking inhaler and
P28: Oh, wow! I don't take an inhaler, and I didn't have to do that there.
S: And surprisingly, even though they are taking inhaler, they think their symptom is mild because.
P28: There are people who are taking inhaler frequently.
S: And they are seeing.
P28: Several times a day.
S: Yeah. And so many people
S: who are suffering more than them. So they think that they are not. they are not a people who are who are suffering from the air quality in Bakersfield.
P28: Wow, that's interesting.
S: So the sensitivity and awareness. They are, so in some way they are vulnerable, but they are, but they think
S: mentally, they think that this is not the big issue for them.
P28: Right? Right? That's really interesting. And I think part of that. TCC Grant, the climate change grant. You know, their focus was on lower socioeconomic neighborhoods and outreach and awareness, and they have a web page. I'll look for it and send it to you where they had some awareness slides. But that's so interesting. I never took an inhaler.
P28: And I I didn't take it there. But I I mean once you could feel you could feel it so. But I yeah.
S: Okay, yeah, thank you very much. It was really valuable.
P28: Yes, really interesting. Okay, we'll stay in touch. And I'll send that, I'm gonna I'm gonna send you the information to [name of an employee], who's environmental justice. You want me to make it an interview in introduction.
S: Yeah, it would be great. I can. If you introduce me through the email, I can contact her also.
P28: Okay, great. Yeah, she is.
P28: She's an environmental justice warrior. So she would be good. And then I'll make an email introduction to [Name of a person the participant recommended]. He's slow to get back, but he will. He would be. I think he might have some good people for you to interview, too.
S: Okay, great, great. Thank you very much. I will keep update this research as well.
P28: Okay. Alright. Thank you.
S: Thank you. Have a good one. Bye, bye.
P28: You, too. Bye-bye.
