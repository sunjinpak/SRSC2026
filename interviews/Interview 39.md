## Transcript
S: Okay. So Participant #39, can you tell us about your current role in your job?
 
[Participant #39]: Yes, so I am. An event supports coordinator for a Ccb. I work in University advancement and the President's office, so I help perform and do events for the President's office. Alumni. I'm now athletics. So just yeah. That's what I do. Events. I've been here around for 2 years now.
 
S: Okay, so does your work require a physical presence in your office?
 
[Participant #39]: Yes.
 
S: Are there any flexibility?
 
[Participant #39]: Oh yes!
 
S: Okay.
 
[Participant #39]: So, yeah.
 
S: Okay, great. All right. So can you walk us through a typical day of working hours and after work hours.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah. So what I do in a typical day is depending. If I have an event that day, so say, if I do have an event to the event that day I would come either on time at 8 am. Or I would come earlier. If it's an earlier event to set up.
Essentially, I do a lot of prep work. It's a lot going back and forth from different buildings on campus where we have stuff like stored. So it's a lot of like physical labor, of setting up gathering items, taking them to different spots on campus, just preparing for the event.
And then, when the event happens, just, you know, overseeing the logistics of the event, making sure it's running smoothly.
And then, after the event, taking down, doing basically everything again. Just reverse putting everything away. And then another part of my role is every day I do some variation of admin work. So I do a lot of the billing free events. I do a lot of support work for my team, just admin in in my team. So yeah, there's a lot of paperwork that I also do as well. So my jobs kind of divided up in half of event work and admin work. And then
After work. I usually work out a gym indoors, and then I come home and I make dinner, and then I go to bed, and then it start all over again.
 
S: Okay, that's great, But do you work out outside of the building? Like outside. Like charging. Yeah. Charging in the river walk.
 
[Participant #39]: I do biking on the bike path. But most of my working out, though, is inside.
 
S: How long you have you lived in San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #39]: Oh, how long I live in here! I lived here my whole life. I just. I did go away for school, though I went. I lived in Idaho for 4 years, though.
 
S: Which state that school is located.
 
[Participant #39]: Boise state is in Idaho.
 
S: Boise state. Okay, I know that. Yeah, it's a good school.
 
S: Yeah. I've considered working there, too. And. I once applied the job over there, but I landed here in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, it's a great, it's a great area. I actually got a marketing degree at Boise State. So.
 
S: Okay, how do you feel about air quality in Bakersfield? So I think you're the perfect person. Because you could, you know. You know. Compare between the area around Boise State and Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, I would say, the air quality here is not the best. I know. I dealt with a lot of family members and friends who have struggled with air quality. Fortunately for me, I haven't had any issues. Come along. I don't have, you know, like asthma or allergies, or I haven't like had valley fever, but I do know quite a few people who've had issues.
but yeah, I I don't think it's the best with. Compared to Boise. Boise was a great place, very, it felt very clean, has 4 seasons. So that was really nice, I think. That helped with, you know, like the way you feel in outside here. Obviously, there's like 2 seasons, it's hot, and then it's just cold. So I think that. But yeah, I would say the air quality here is not the best, but I'm just kind of used to it, I guess.
S: So since you had lived in Bakersfield for quite a while, has your perspective on air quality has been changed during that time.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, I think as I got older, I think I realized more that there is deeper issues, you know, with air quality and how it affects people's life, and especially like being able to perform outside and do different activities. Yeah, it has changed. I guess I wasn't really aware of the air when I was younger. But yeah, it has evolved to know that. Oh, this is not good, or when you know you see on the news. That's bit bad air quality, or you see a live shot of you know the area above the town, and you know, in the sky you can see, like the fog and the the grossness. I feel like it's a lot coming from like the La area, too, you know, because we're like stuck in the grapevine. Yeah.
 
S: Okay, do you think that air quality has been improved? across time?
 
[Participant #39]: I guess I'm not sure if it has improved. Yeah, I'm not. I don't know enough to know.
 
S: So I think your awareness about the air quality and the knowledge, about the air quality has been, you know, increased you were born and raised here, and were there any specific moment or event or conversation that really, you know, increase your. The awareness of the air quality.
 
[Participant #39]: I think, though I think there's an exact moment. But my husband he works in news. So I I now a little bit more aware what's going on in our community from him. So I see more reports about how valley fever has risen and stuff like that. So I think when he started working in the news. And then I started working before this job in nonprofit. I worked a lot outside in, like lower to moderate income areas.
I started realizing the impact that it has on people's health. So I think during that time, probably right after college, when I came back to live in Bakersville. I started realizing that the air is worse than I, I guess, growing up because I didn't really experience anything bad to me for the air.
 
S: Can you elaborate more about how people people's daily activities is affected by the air quality in Bakersfield? I think you are more knowledgeable than us, because you have been grown here, and also you have, you know, friends in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #39]: What what has, what has impacted them?
 
S: Yes.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, I think it's just like chances to. And like the way people also take care of themselves. I don't know how health conscious Bakersfield is, but living. My mother she was a smoker. She's a secondhand smoker, so she lives with Copd, so I see that I see those effects. And then I also see that yeah, valley fever can happen really to to anybody, you know, if they're in the right, you know social situation. And then also, like allergies that's really big here. I see the way that impacts people. And I know a friend who had valley fever really bad, and is still like suffering effects from that 10 years later. And that's like really scary to see.
 
S: Since you are scared about having valley fever, have you ever modified your work, or personal activities or schedules due to the air quality concerns.
 
[Participant #39]: I don't think I have. I feel like if the weather is bad for events outside, or sometimes when we get those wind storms, you know. And it's picking up a lot of dust. We are definitely more cautious about what we do. I don't think anything, has I? I haven't spoke up to not want to do my job. Either. We'll wear masks now or we limit our time outside. So my team's kind of knowledgeable on that like I mean, like to the degree of let's take care of ourselves first.st But I haven't really spoken up personally to. That's I'm afraid that's gonna affect my health.
 
S: Do you think that air quality affects your team's work, productivity, or attendance.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, I think it definitely affects our productivity, especially not only the air quality, but the heat. We try not to do events in the summertime because it's really hot. And my, I have a team member that it affects her health because she has other health issues. But yeah, it does affect us,
 
S: Okay? So what actions have you took to deal with the air quality issue?
 
[Participant #39]: I think my action I've taken most is wearing a mask when it when we think that we don't want to breathe in something with the air in the wind and stuff in the dust. That's what I've taken more seriously now that I'm older I never did that when I was a child, so.
 
S: So but sometimes people feel hesitant to wear a mask, because there are some stereotype among people, so have you ever felt hesitant to wear a mask. But even though you want to take it.
 
[Participant #39]: Right, recently. No, I haven't felt like embarrassed to wear a mask, maybe prior to Covid. I probably wouldn't want to have worn a mask if somebody said to, probably not but now, after Covid, I think a lot of people's minds have shifted regarding mask, but I still think there is that stereotype, of course.
 
S: Among the people? Which demographic, do you think that they have those kind of stereotypes, like men, or female.
 
[Participant #39]: Probably men.
 
S: Why do you think?
 
[Participant #39]: Men think that because it's more of like, oh, kind of like that. Suck up, you know. Suck it up behavior like, just get over it, or it's not that big of a deal. Don't be like a that, men the toxic masculinity like don't be a wuss about something, you know.
S: How comfortable are people in your workplace with discussing error quality concerns.
 
[Participant #39]: I feel like pretty comfortable we're pretty. I feel like in in my division. We're pretty open to talking about matters and then taking action if needed.
 
S: If the newcomers, newly employed in your team and if they talk about that air quality in bakersfield as a peep as a person who, born and raised in Bakersfield. Do you think that they are too overreacting.
 
[Participant #39]: No, no, I don't think so. Maybe just because I'm born here, I'm maybe I'm just grown up with it. I'm I'm immune to it. But I know a lot of people coming from different places and start getting really bad allergies or start having bad health issues because of it, because they're not used to it. So I definitely I don't think they're overacting at all.
 
S: Hmm! Have you ever shared personal or family concerns about the air quality issues with your colleagues?
 
[Participant #39]: I don't know. I don't think so.
 
S: How about your colleagues? Did they share their personal or family concerns with around air quality issues with you?
 
[Participant #39]: I know one of my colleagues. She's not from here, and she moved here 7 years ago, so I know she's expressed the air quality, obviously the heat to me and issues with her health before. So yeah, they have expressed it before. But it's not a A regular conversation.
 
S: Do you think that your colleagues are also comfortable? Talking about error quality concerns.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, I think they are.
 
S: Okay. The reason why I ask this is that there's some people hesitant to talk about air quality issue because they think that it always lead them to talk about the political, you know, issue.
I'm not. I haven't experienced this. Maybe because I'm from South Korea. They don't talk about political issue with me, but from your standpoint have you ever observed, or feel something like that.
 
[Participant #39]: I don't think I yeah, I I felt like a political connotation with air pollution, I know, like environmental and like more of a you know, like gas and other factors are kind of political, but I haven't really felt like the air pollution has been political. I think it's pretty clear that. you know. If if you what side you're on, the air pollution is not great here. And yeah, I I haven't felt a political connotation.
 
S: Sometimes people feel a sense of connection with others when facing common challenges. So in Bakersfield, we all know that we have a poor air quality.
So when you learn that others share similar environmental concerns like, you know, pollutions from the air and dust from everywhere. How do you feel?
 
[Participant #39]: I think I feel, yeah, the same way as how other people feel about how it's. You know how it affects us. The thing is, I don't really. I guess we don't, really. I don't hear or talk about like the change aspect of like. What can we do to better it. So that's like an interesting like point of view to look at it. But yeah, I feel neutral about it.
I haven't heard, I guess somebody say the air pollution is great, you know. So yeah, I feel like a yeah, like, we come together on a common ground.
 
S: Okay, have you ever thought that sharing your experiences with aero pollution? Or you know understandings? Others talk about their concerns about the air pollutions.
Do you think those lead to you and your colleague feel more connection connected with the you know connected with each other?
 
[Participant #39]: No, I guess I don't. I don't feel us being more connect when we talk about it.
 
S: Have you ever felt isolated, due to the environmental health concerns.
 
[Participant #39]: No, I haven't felt isolated.
  
S: have you ever felt like your concerns about the air quality issues might be dismissed as overreacting or being, too, sensitive.
 
[Participant #39]: No.
 
S: Okay, let's talk about the organizational effort. So what steps has your organization? Cs to be taken to address air quality issues?
 
[Participant #39]: I have no idea what steps they've taken, either I haven't been made aware, or I'm not like paying attention, and that could just be to the point of that, because it hasn't really affected me in my life. And so that could be just have a blind eye to that.
But yeah, I don't know what steps they've taken. Obviously, I've seen like steps of when it comes to the heat, you know, of course, but I haven't seen steps in regards to air pollution.
  
S: what kinds of support or initiative do you think that your organization can provide to better address air quality concerns.
 
[Participant #39]: I think they can provide, you know, like maybe information and tools, especially to new employees who join that are not from the area, you know, because it is a university. We do get a lot of, you know, faculty and staff that are not, you know, from Bakersfield. So even providing tools and ways to ensure that their health is good and what to avoid, and like valley fever, how? That's so. No known here. It's not known in other places as much. So even just giving like tools and information to help people succeed, especially if they're moving here. And then just you know, being aware that. Oh, today's a bad, you know air quality Day. Let's encourage employees and staff not to go outside, or and even students as well. So yeah, I could take better action on that front.
 
S: Have you ever request your manager to stay that you want to stay inside when the air quality out outside is specifically worse.
 
[Participant #39]: I haven't.
 
S: Okay, how about the other coworkers?
 
[Participant #39]: I don't think so. I haven't seen anybody ask that.
 
S: How about manager? Did they voluntarily ask you to stay inside? Because because today we have a bad weather.
 
[Participant #39]: No.
 
S: No. Okay.
 
S: Considering the current air quality issues, do you see yourself continuing to live and work in Bakersfield for long term?
 
[Participant #39]: I see myself. I didn't expect to move back to Bakersfield after college, but I graduated during Covid. So job opportunities were limited, so I didn't expect to, and now that I'm here all my family's here, so I don't see myself not living here for a good amount of time. I I see myself being here for a long time. If I would move. It's because of either better job, opportunity or retirement.
 
S: Just curious. What was the main reason you choose, Boise, state 
In California. There are lots of good school as well with the ower tuition.
 
[Participant #39]: Right. I think I chose boy state because Bakersfield kind of has a stigma when you grow up here that you don't, that it's a. It's a bad, bad place, and you don't want to be here. You want to leave your hometown, you know, and I felt when I I just felt Idaho. Another State was a better place for me, just because if I was gonna stay and go to school in California it would be Csuv, because I couldn't afford rent in other csus in California and rent Idaho is really cheap. So that was my way to go out of state, but also be still have low income low. Housing.
 
S: Okay, I understand. I heard that nowadays. I doubt the living cost is really expensive.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, it it right when I left people start because I left 2020. So that's when it really started booming and it's very. I think it's getting high up expensive. A lot of people are moving there, retiring.
H: Participant #39. Just a quick question about Bakersfield being a bad place.
I have been. I've been to Bakersfield like once, so I'm not as knowledgeable as you do. You mind elaborating on that stigma or on that point right.
 
[Participant #39]: I think. Well, our crime rate per capita is not good here, of course. The heat is not encouraging. I think there are bad parts of Bakersfield. But it's really growing. I've seen a big change since high school, and also, I think when you're in that age, from you know, 13 to 18. It's like you just want to get out of where you're at, you know, and that there's nothing to do here. It's just an agriculture town. It's hot, bad pollution, bad crime. I think. I think that all plays a factors, and just also being at the age like, I just want to leave my hometown so I would say those are the factors.
But now, as I get older, I see the good qualities right. You know Bakersfield is one of the cheaper places to live in California, you know, and it's a growing city. It is a place to raise a family, you know there is community here, but you don't see that when you're younger, you know you just you don't see that. You just see the bigger picture. You don't see all the small things that come.
 
H: yeah, thanks for sharing. So and going back to the our the beginning of our interview, I think Dr. Park here, he asked you whether your job was flexible, so can you elaborate on that part on what terms it is flexible.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah. So my, my job is flexible, especially in the summertime. Because we do have limited events like, I'm working from home today. During. You know the semester. It's less flexible, because obviously my job is in. It's events. So I have to be there in person. But my job can be flexible, because my boss is very. She is very understanding. If I do need to work from home, because I have. You know somebody repairing my seat? You know I do have that flexibility just from a personal aspect, having that relationship with her, but also yeah, my job. I guess it's more from her perspective, not because of my role. She allows me to have that flexibility. My role doesn't say that I could be remote. Does that make sense.
  
H: So in large part, I mean, I guess it is having a supportive. Boss, right. does she allow that I mean for your other teammates as well.
 
[Participant #39]: Yes.
 
H: Department, okay, okay, makes sense.
 
[Participant #39]: Yeah, but there's just 3 of us. So.
 
H: Oh, okay. Right? Okay.
 
[Participant #39]: But I know there's other. It's good comparison, because there's other admin coordinators. That's what like. Technically, I am in my division, and they don't get to work from home at all, so I know. Compared to them, I do have more flexibility.
 
H: Okay. Alright. Thank you.
 
S: Okay, let's go back to your long term plans. So what the factors most influence your decisions about staying and or live in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #39]: I think cost of living, and my family, my husband and my family is here, so makes sense, for if we want to start. A family and childcare, you know, support.
 
S: So always stay close to our mother.
  
[Participant #39]: Children, because I can't afford health care yet.
 
S: what changes would make you feel more optimistic about living and working in Bakersfield for long term.
 
[Participant #39]: I guess I think, seeing that community growth and ever changing. And I feel like it is. It is expanding new, like shopping centers and new things to do in our community to support each other has been, you know, coming up. I think that will encourage me. Obviously better better crime rates and our education is pretty good here, too, just making sure that keeps going up and not going down. And then also.
yeah, just better. Pollution would help. Obviously, of course, the weather's not gonna change. I don't think Bakersfield is. Gonna get 4 seasons anytime soon, but it did snow here in 1999. So you never know. But yeah, I think, just yeah, just the way our community has is growing and improving. I think that would keep continue for me to stay.
 
S: So we are continuing this interview research. And do you have any recommendation that we can have a questions to the future interviewee.
 
[Participant #39]: Hmm, it's a good question. I think. Yeah, I think all the questions are really good. Especially people who have been in impacted by the pollution, you know, by pollution and stuff. yeah, I I think they're great questions. I I don't have any. Yeah. Add ons.
 
S: Okay, I think I have consumed all the questions I prepared. Dr. Lee. Do you have any question for Participant #39?
 
S: Nope.
 
S: okay, Participant #39, thanks for participating in our research, and I will soon send you the $40 gift card for your valuable perspectives.
Yeah, I hope you have a great day.
