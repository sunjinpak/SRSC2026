## Transcript
S: Andrew, we appreciate your willingness to participate in this interview, which should take about 45 min, and once we finish the interview you will receive $40
Amazon gift card, and our goal is to understand your experiences, living and working in San Joaquin Valley, especially concerning environmental issues like air pollution. Your insights are valuable and will help us better comprehend how these experiences influence community connections.
 
S: Okay, so first of all, shall we talk about your current role in your job? And we just wanted to know, what kind of role do you have in your job and any required physical presence, or any flexibility in working indoors or or outdoors, something like that.
 
[Participant #18]: Okay? Well, right now, I work for Ross in Ross distribution centers. I'm a payroll administrator. I'm a hundred percent on site. So I work in the office.
I am, yeah, no, no reason to be outside. So yeah, this is the standard office environment.
 
S: So, how long have you been working in this role.
 
[Participant #18]: On almost. It'll be a year in 2 weeks.
 
S: And can you please walk us through a typical day, including your both and non-work activities?
 
[Participant #18]: Okay. So my day starts off at 6 in the morning. I am by myself. We are a team of 4. I am the 1st one on the team to arrive at work. I'll be there covering the payroll window for all the associates that should have any questions, whether it's with Adp, whether they have enough sick hours, vacation hours to cover the days they've met, the time they've missed.
So it's primarily I'm by myself for the 1st hour and a half until 7:30, when my partner shows up right there. In the meantime, during then that time I'll be sending out correctives, whether it's a written warning, verbal warning, anything for associates that trigger for attendance, whether they have missed too much time or they don't have enough time to cover those days.
So I start my day off with that till I do that about until 10 o'clock.
10 o'clock. I'll take my break. Then, once I get back from my lunch break, I will get to emails and that email, those that involves respond to emails for people that have opened up a leave of absence whether it's personal employee, medical, anything like that and processing them within our kronos software. moving their accounts to PIN codes loa codes. So they're not they're not getting more points for their correctives for their occurrences.
I do that for another hour and a half, and then I send out timesheets for the people that that have not returned their time sheets. That verifies the time that they worked, that the associate agrees to getting paid these certain amount of hours. I do that for an hour and a half I split the split. The work is split between me and another partner of mine, a 3rd person on the team. So I do. Half of that I send out about, I would say. I think, for example, today I sent out believe 86 my partner will send out the rest. So we'll just put that up at the end of the day I'll go through the the call outs people that Miss Time that did not call out. So I will send an email for no call, no shows to supervisor managers and they'll verify whether it's a true no call, no show, or say they missed a punch you know, at the when the clock in clock outs.
Let's see, what else do I got? Yeah, other than that. Just answering questions. Whatever associates have just answering various questions, whether it's bereavement, pay anything. There's like jury duty. very simple like that.
 
S: So after work. What? What do you do? In normal days.
 
[Participant #18]: After work. I would say, typically, I stay home for an hour or 2, just rest up a little bit whether I take a small small nap, or, you know, just have some downtime, and then after that I'll go to the gym. I'll do that for an hour or 2. I would say, I do that 2 to 3 times out the week out the work week. So yeah, I do that. And then just various things, also just spending time with whoever, whether it be my family partner.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: So, aside from commuting, it sounds like you don't need to work outside in any ways. Right?
 
[Participant #18]: Correct.
 
S: Hmm, okay, and let's move on to the next section around personal background. And how long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley?
 
[Participant #18]: I've lived in the valley all my life. I'm 26 years old. So yeah, my whole life.
 
S: So your parents moved to San Joaquin Valley.
 
[Participant #18]:Yes, my parents moved here, both from Mexico.
 
S: How do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley?
 
[Participant #18]: I know, I hear I hear hear about it read about it all the time. I experience it every day. I know it's among the worst in the country.
you know. And then I know. For example, when I go to Tehachapi I notice the fresh air. It, you know, I feel like my body's built up to it. I feel like I'm used to this air quality. So this is all I know. But definitely when I venture out elsewhere. I definitely know when there's better air quality, it's off. Yeah.
S: Yeah, your parents from outside of this community. And how do they talk about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley.
 
[Participant #18]: Oh, the same exact, same exact thing. It's terrible!
You know they don't. They're not sure why it's so rough here. I know that has to do with the whole valley, you know, and the air comes in from other places. The smog comes in from other places. So yeah, we have really similar views on that.
 
S: Okay. I heard that some of the professors were raised and born in Fresno, in San Joaquinbelly, and they said, the air quality has been definitely changed, and I just wanted to know your perspective, how the air quality has been changed across years since. You recognize the the quality of the air.
 
[Participant #18]: Honestly, as I've gotten older, I don't think I've noticed any change for
Always been here in Bakersfield. I don't think I've noticed a difference between that.
 
S: So you think that it's the air quality is quite similar to you what you have experienced before.
 
[Participant #18]: I would say so. Yes, definitely.
 
S: okay, and regarding the the concerns about the air quality and the place you're living in, especially in Bakersfield. that your perspective on the environment or air quality has been changed.
 
[Participant #18]: No, I feel like I'm just a little more knowledgeable of what different things that could come from being in this environment like my whole life and all the different issues that could come with it, health issues. So I just become a little bit more knowledgeable on specific things. With that.
 
S: Okay. Some people says they had experienced some health issue from themselves or from their friends or from their, you know, sibling or their parents. So because of those experiences, they had developed their perspective on air quality, which is air quality, is really important for our health. And were there any experiences you had went through throughout the years.
 
[Participant #18]: Myself. I wouldn't say so. I know. I've you know, been around people that have, you know. I don't know if this applies, but if they've caught in valley fever.
I know that was terrible. So that was not a good experience. So I know that was something that was really touches that. So yeah. That's the major one.
 
S: Oh, I just wanted to clear it out. You had caught belly fever.
 
[Participant #18]: Not myself. I had a closer friend of mine. She had gotten valley fever. Yeah.
 
S: Okay, can you elaborate more about that symptoms.
 
[Participant #18]: I know she was just. It seemed like such a really bad sickness, I would say.
I know, she she complained about crazy headaches. She she was out for I believe it was about I would say over more than 2 weeks.
 
S: Hmm.
 
[Participant #18]: Yeah, it was quite some time. And yeah, she now, at the time I did not understand the severity of that whole valley fever. But now I understand. Yeah, that was about, I would say, close to 10 years back.
 
S: Oh, so after your close friend caught up the valley fever. do you feel that you can also experience that symptoms.
 
[Participant #18]: No, I think, yeah, I think there's potential for that to happen at some point. Hopefully, not.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Just one following question, have your perspective or thoughts on air quality changed at all, either after she got a vally fever.
 
[Participant #18]: If it had, if my view set changed afterwards.
 
[Participant #18]: Definitely. Yeah, I know. Especially with that so specific to our region. So just that made me more aware and more knowledgeable on that. You know how bad, what the the effects of the air quality has here.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: And just curious. You mentioned that you have lived in Valley for your entire life. Have you ever lived anywhere else in the State, even just like for a few years or few months.
 
[Participant #18]: No, never! It's been here my whole life.
 
 
S: so let's talk about how the air quality in Bakersfield impacted your daily life. So we frequently experienced heavy dust with the heavy winds, and also during the winter, because of the heat waves, we experienced a high level of ozone in our city. and sometimes we could also smell some you know the the. the smell from the the you know, the farm which raises their cows. So in what ways have you dealt with the air quality.
 
[Participant #18]: I know in my daily life I work. I work out in Shafter. So it's a very rural area, I would say a rural area. Shafter. I have a 25 min commute to work 2530 min, and majority of that is through agriculture areas farms and everything. I know every single day.
I see there's times. There's only one at least one time where I see a I'm driving through a cloud of dust every single day, 2 and one time to work, and one time going home from work.
I know that's definitely not good breathing in every single day. That's a guarantee. Every day that I come across that and also, as I'm driving through these farmlands. There's, you know, you smell different things, whether it's like, I know there's a garlic field out there. There's different, you know. You smell different pesticides. It's not different different smells every day. The garlic smells there every day, though, but you know whether it's you know they must spray a pesticide or something that we definitely breathe that into.
So yeah, just that every day. it has some sort. It will have some sort of effect on my health at some point. you know, I'm sure it's not meant to be breathed in every day. But you know I do experience that every single day that I go out to to work.
 
S: So in order to avoid those air quality issue? Have you ever used any preventive gears like mask? Or, you know, air filter in your home or at your work, or at when you walk outside of the building.
 
[Participant #18]: I know at work. They have specific air filters. They told us about all the time, but the thing with that I'm not sure what it is, but it like it meant like a black dust.
I think that's a yeah. I'm not sure what the black dust is. But if I take this like charcoal, I know charcoal is a real thing that filters lot of stuff. So I know there's that at work. They tell us they told me that was one of the 1st things they told me at work.
As for masks, I've never worn, I've never worn a mask or anything out there as I'm driving. I know I do. I'm sure it doesn't help much, but I always keep the window up when I'm driving through that farmland. Other than that, I don't really take any. There's no preventive action that I take for that.
 
S: It seems like you are very healthy, and because the air quality does not impact your health a lot. Maybe that's why you don't much, you know. Uses utilize those preventive gears.
 
[Participant #18]: I would say so, I would agree with that.
 
S: I know you're quite healthy. And you're strong with the air quality issue. But when you look around your family members or friends or your coworkers. Have you noticed that they were struggling with handling the air quality around them?
 
[Participant #18]: Oh, oh, definitely my one of my partners here at work. She had just moved in from LA I would say in December. and when she came down here you could 1st thing She was getting like allergies and even to this day, like it's it's ramping up even more with the hotter weather coming in. And you can definitely tell, yeah, she's not, you know, definitely. Tell that she's not built up. She's not adapted to this air quality. As for yeah, I would say, that's a real good example. Right there. She yeah, she's definitely, even to this day, not adjusted to it.
 
S: So regarding the air quality issue, have you talked about how she could? You know the new employee? Could, you know, adapt it to the new environment. And you know. in current county.
 
[Participant #18]: We haven't really talked about anything like that just mainly
I would say, if anything, mainly we've talked about things to like treat it. You know whether it's type of medicine things my other coworkers taken things I've taken if I ever needed it, and things that are available at the nurse's office that are on site.
But other than that, we haven't really touched on anything else other than that.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: I have one question, because I have no experience about the Bakersfield, and San Joaquin Valley. And you mentioned having a friend who experienced vally fever. And also you mentioned your coworker who moved from the La has some allergy issues, so do these things continue to have a lasting impact for people at there? Or do you think that people generally stop thinking much about them once they've adjusted or adopted to those environment.
 
[Participant #18]: I would say that it definitely has a longer impact on them. You know something just to that's something they'll always be mindful of, you know, especially being down over here.
Yeah, I definitely think it goes, for beyond, it's definitely longer lasting.
 
S: and just curious. Andrew, you know, I'm from South Korea and but i'm quite new to the Hispanic culture in Bakersfield. I think we have a quite unique culture. It's definitely different from Mexico, and I felt like very less. People are wearing masks, even though we have a dusty wind, and occasionally in the campus and also male students are less likely to wear masks.
do you think there are some kind of social pressure, make them to wear the mask less frequent.
 
[Participant #18]: I would say, at least, for the Hispanic culture. I know especially it's, you know, it's point that you bring up specifically male students as well that I guess I think there's like a sort of pressure that you got to feel tougher.
Wearing doing these preventative things wearing a mask this or that to makes you seem as a little as a little more weak than people that don't wear masks that just accept it and just toughen up. I guess, I know that's definitely that would be definitely like, something behind all that.
yeah, I know. Yeah, I would say that just matter of looking tough.
You know, as in this sick. If I get sick, then I get sick and I'll I'll deal with it. Type of thing like, yeah, just I know that's pretty common a common ideology with between Hispanic community.
 
S: I think South Korea also have those kind of issue. So you know, social Korean alcohol people tend to feel stronger and more productive if they could have more alcohol than they can.
And also, do you think those kind of culture make, you know people hesitant to share about the air code issue because that could reveal their weakness.
 
[Participant #18]: I'd say that's a fair. That'd be a fair statement. I would say I would agree with that.
Yeah, nobody wants to show any weakness, and whether it's something small, something, Major, I think any weakness shown is. you know, people would like to avoid that. I would say so.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: I'm just curious about even at the workplace, or from your personal experience. Do you see difference in how your like, I would say, like your male colleagues and the female colleagues approach and talk about the air quality issues.
Do you see any kind of differences? Or, if so, do you have any specific experience or example.
 
[Participant #18]: Differences. I would say. I know that girls are more girls. Women are more open to speaking about things like that. but I know when it comes to like for myself and my other coworker. We are the 1st 2 to get there, so we have our own time to, you know, interact with when it comes to just both of us. I know, at least, for you know we talk every single day, and I know from our interactions. We never speak of anything like this, anything that we're feeling, not feeling the best when it comes to this or that, whether it's air quality. But I know it's more opening when the women start. come in.
 
S: So, Andrew, it seems like you. You are less likely to share your personal or family concerns or issues related to air quality with your colleagues. But do you ever had any incident? You have shared those concerns with other people?
 
[Participant #18]: There. If it comes up then I'll you know I'll join in the conversation, so I can relate to them, or, you know, share my point on it, you know. Now, there's definitely been times where you know I don't shy. I try not shy away from it. However, I won't be the 1st to bring it up.
 
S: Okay, definitely, depend on the personality people have. There are people who want to share first. there are people who just wanted to, you know, follow up the discussion. If this, if the other person brought up.
 
[Participant #18]: That's That's quite natural.
 
S: Could you share any examples of when you share this? Those experiences sharing with sharing about the concerns on the air quality issues with your colleagues, especially in your workplace.
 
[Participant #18]: I know when I was 1st getting adjusted to working in Shafter. I've never worked. I've never.
Besides working here, I've never had any reason to go to Shafter. You know I was. I very rarely ever came to Shafter. You know. and I know when I 1st started working there, there'd be times where the smell of garlic and then all the farmlands and stuff it would. It would be a little too much in my head. I would have headaches.
you know, right there, that was just like, I know there was a nurse on on site right there. So.and I'm sure my coworkers dealt with it before he comes same time as me same place. So I've asked him like, you know, hey? Like, what do you do for this? Do you have anything? Does the nurse have anything?
So I just yeah, just small talk about like, you know. the same stuff we drive through. He lives. He actually lives in Shafter. So maybe he's used to a little more of the farmland than I am. So so yeah, it's just I know. That was definitely a big old change driving through, especially that garlic. It's really strong, and it stays in your, I feel like it stays in your clothes all day. So I feel like that. That's what gave me a headache that it's lingered around all day.
 
S: I also smell the garlic stuffs around grapevine. And is that a real garlic smell? Or is that a smell of pesticides or other other stuff.
 
[Participant #18]: Honest, I I go back and forth.
I say garlic, because one of the managers came in, and he was telling us about the garlic fields. So I put it together. I'm just assuming I just put it together. I just connected it with the smell. So that's why I say, garlic.
 
S: let's talk about about your colleagues, whether they have shared their personal or family concerns related to the air quality with with you. Can you share any examples of those cases.
 
[Participant #18]: Besides, that time I said, where my newer coworker she came in when she came in from. La
you know, it's funny. I think I'm the only person that's from Bakersfield or the surrounding cities.
There's another coworker she's from la as well. But she's lived here most of her life. I know she's, you know, we out of all the many conversations we've had. I know there's been a time where she's talked about the difference when she moved over here from la you know la is not doesn't have the worst, I mean doesn't have the best air quality either. But even then she says she still noticed a difference.
How nasty it could be out here. So And then same with my other coworker. He's from Lancaster. so I would say it's, I would say, fairly similar to Bakersfield. or anything in the valley, for the most part with him. Same thing with him. Just allergies. You know. Nothing nothing, Major. Nothing, Major, between any of the coworkers. But yeah, it's just been real minor things on anything that we've talked about.
 
S: based on your discussion with your colleagues to talk about the error code issue, we just wanted to discuss about whether those discussion will lead to some connection with your colleagues. So sometimes people feel connected with others when facing common challenges, like dealing with, you know, garlic smell like you and me? And how did it feel to realize that your colleagues are also experiencing similar challenges with air, quality or topics they could relate with, and having an open conversation, starting with the air quality.
[Participant #18]: us, I would say, like a sense of comfort, knowing that, you know we're all dealing with the same thing whether you know I'm not the only one dealing with it. My coworkers are just. you know, not as much, but a little bit more of like, you know, we are a team, you know. We're all dealing with the same thing. even though we all they all come from different places. We're all still dealing with the same stuff.
Just, you know, and it's a little thing, but something that I'm sure we'll appreciate something we can all relate to. so I'll just say, yeah, just as just a small sense of comfort, knowing we're all dealing with the same stuff and relate to it.
 
S: How has feeling more connected to others, influenced your thoughts, related to the air pollution.
 
[Participant #18]: Oh, that's good. Oh, sorry. Yeah, it's definitely I feel like
If it were to come up, or if I you know, think about it at some point. You know, some of these days I'll definitely I'd you know I'd be more open talking about it, whether it's me bringing it up, or a coworker brings it up. And we, you know, have a discussion about it. I think you know.
understanding that we all yeah, we're just more open to and more comfort comfortable talking about these things. If it were to come up.
 
S: You know you're committing to your company. And you had experience. Shared that you also feel some air quality issue while you commute while you drive and also, you know, some days air quality is really good, and some days air quality is not okay, right? And what do you think your organization can? Take an action to help you to address the air quality issues.
 
[Participant #18]: I would say just I would think. You know, I know I earlier I'd mentioned with those filters all that it leaves like a black residue bind for things that sit too long. So I'll say something like that, because, you know, I'm sure that gets all over my desk and stuff, and you know I'm touching it. And who knows what comes of that? You know what you know? Potential risks of me, you know, ingesting that, or, you know. So I'll say you know something that's less. or whether it's that or replacing the filters more frequently.
And then, other than that I would I would say No other than that, I'd say I'm not sure what else can be done regarding that. But I would say I would start there with the replacing the filters a little bit more.
 
S: so when there's a heavy dust out there with a heavy wind, some you know company provides some work schedule flexibility. So that employees can decide when to come to the workplace or when to, you know, start their work schedules.
So have you thought about those? You know, practices in your organization more flexibility or work from home.
 
[Participant #18]: Yeah, I've I've I know that was a thought going into my cause. At first, st when I my first, st I would say like 6 months. I was working a 7, 3, 30 schedule, and now I moved it up to 6. At 2 30.
I noticed a lot less traffic to and from work. Moving to 6 6 in the morning rather versus 7 in the morning. So and then with that, I mean, you know less dust. I would I would imagine.
 
S: So I've only thought of that. And then I know some positions are work are remote.
 
[Participant #18]: And I'm sure that's a pretty big benefit, you know.
saving that drive, having to drive through all that every single day. I'm sure it all adds up to be more beneficial for my health.
If I were to have the that schedule so yeah, I would say and I would say there is some flexibility that my job offers with that. So yeah, definitely.
 
S: Hmm!
 
S: And it feels like you, you think that your organization cannot improve the air quality quality around you?
Why do you think like that. or does. My, you know, understanding is correct.
 
[Participant #18]: I'm yeah. I just wouldn't. just thinking about it. And I not I just can't think of anything random word what they can improve other than the whether it's providing like.
Or changing. The air filters more frequently.
 
S: Okay. So considering the current air quality issue, do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area for long term?
 
[Participant #18]: Oh, long term! I feel like I would if that were the case. where I'd be long term. I think I'd be good enough for it. I think I I'd continue to hopefully continue to be healthy, being in this environment.
However, best case it'd be nice to not have to deal with that with this air quality. So preferably, I would like to. you know, be elsewhere, where I don't have to drive through all that every day, but if it comes down to it I feel like It wouldn't it would have an impact, but not as much I would say others, because I feel like my body's adjusted to it.
 
S: so. But do you think that if the air quality is better here without less dust? Do you think that you can live here for long term.
 
[Participant #18]: Definitely, yes.
 
S: So the air quality is the main factor that you think that you might. consider other community with a good. You know, environment.
 
[Participant #18]: Yes, that is a main factor. Correct.
 
S: Do you think that other workers also share this sentiment with you? So if they earn some career experiences and with those do you think they also want to find a job? Other other place other than this, you know Valley area.
 
[Participant #18]: Definitely. I would say, there's some common thinking with a lot of people.
With that, just for the better air quality, a lot more green in the area. So yeah, definitely.
 
S: okay, this is the last question. But I just wanted before I mentioned this last question, I just wanted to appreciate your genuine, you know. of sharing your perspective on air quality around us. So is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with air quality and community connections in the San Joaquin Valley that we haven't discussed.
 
[Participant #18]: No other than just.
I'm not sure if you know me living in this environment, my whole life has any effect making my body more, you know, built up to being in this environment. I'm not sure if that has an effect. But yeah, other than that, I don't have anything else that I would like to add on.
 
S: Okay, thank you very much. Andrew.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: I have one last question, because I've never actually been to, or lived in any part of the belly, or like Bakersfield. So if I were to relocate to another area in San Joaquin Valley, say like for work, because I heard a lot of great opportunities out there. So do you have any advice for managing issues like air quality or the heat.
 
[Participant #18]: I would say, take, you know, definitely take as much precaution as you can. I know it's a big difference to most compared to most places, so I'll just, you know, ease into it, I'll say, like, you know, wear your mask have, like, you know, air filters, whether it's in the house in the car. A car is a big thing. Change the air filter there because those things could get really dusty real fast.
I think that's a great, great starting point.
