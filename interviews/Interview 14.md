# Interview 14

## Transcript
S: So I have started this research on how air quality impact employees in Bakersfield and
S: I heard some story that some of the people are considering move to other community outside of Bakersfield, where the air quality is good because they had experienced a lot of
S: you know, health issue from their they're kiddos.
S: So I just embarked at how employees
S: could feel that they could invest in their effort and time to this organization and this community.
S: even though they are, they are experiencing air quality issue. So this research purposes to find out how the the State government, or municipal
S: or, you know organization could guide employees to, you know.
S: Face the
S: their challenges from the air quality and how they could, you know, help to clean the air
S: by, you know, planting the tree or some kind of you know. Csr activities corporate social responsibilities.
S: So that was basic, you know, intention of why I have initiated this research.
P14: Okay. Sounds good.
S: And thanks for participating.
P14: Sure, glad to help.
S: I would like to hear your opinions about air quality issue, and and I would spend
S: around 45 min. But it could be less than 45 min, and after we complete the interview,
S: you will receive $20 Amazon gift card.
S: and our goal is to understand your experiences, living and working in sun Hawking Valley.
S: So let's start.
S: So can you please let me check. The recording is okay.
S: So could you tell us about your current role in your job.
P14: Yes, so currently, I am a
P14: safety specialist, and I work for the [XXX] Court.
P14: and I am mostly indoors, but we do travel to different court locations. We are here in Bakersfield, but we have locations in Ridgegrest, Mojave, Lamont, Delano, Shafter.
P14: It's all office work that we have. We do have janitorial staff that does go outside, but they don't spend a lot of time outside.
P14: And we oversee them. And yeah, my job is really mostly safety.
S: So I think your job is quite related to this research topic, because it is all about health issue of our employees.
S: So
S: Do you have some kind of flexibility?
S: on what time you work, or which you know, place you work, depend on the situations.
P14: So my, I'm mostly located here downtown. [Street name] here in Bakersfield. Whenever something comes up we tend to it, so we'll plan. We'll schedule, or we'll just go out to the locations as needed. But my workstation is located here. [Street name].
P14: oh, okay, from there they deploy me.
S: All right.
S: I think
S: Song Hyoun Hong from Georgia State University. He joined our meeting. He's also my colleague, and I would like to introduce him to P14.
P14: Hello! Good to see you, P14! I'm Song.
P14: Hi! Nice to meet you, Song.
S: Okay, so we are currently working on the section one
S: about his current role and responsibilities.
S: And now, can you please walk us through a typical day, including both work and non-work activities.
P14: Okay, sounds good. So because I'm working here in Bakersfield, I live in [location] Bakersfield, and it takes me about 25 or 30 min to drive to commute downtown coming in from the [location]. So I just take the [location]. Plenty of cars get downtown, plenty of traffic, plenty of cars down here as well.
P14: Normally, I come into the office and I will check my emails in the 1st part of the morning. If there are meetings we normally try and schedule something after 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock. It's all indoors. So it's either phone, zoom or in person.
P14: If we have to address something out of across the street at [street name] in traffic court, or anything else, and we just get back into a [workplace name] vehicle.
P14: These are regular combustion engine vehicles, and we just drive over handle that. Come back lunch. It's just pretty much do whatever you need to do for lunch for an hour, come back to work.
P14: and then the afternoons. It's make sure that anything else that pops up in emails.
P14: We just tend to the end of the day. For me. It's I have school. I have classes after work. So Mondays and Wednesdays I leave here at 4:30,
P14: drive over to [university name]. Try and find parking there. Handle 2 classes, and then after that it's just dinner and go home
P14: on wins on Tuesdays and Thursdays class with [Professor name] at 4 o'clock, so I leave here at 3
P14: same thing. Go home, handle homework and take care of other things. But that's mostly it for the work days.
S: All right.
S: And I know you had worked at your current organization for around 30 years. But
S: I just wanted to ask, how long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley.
P14: So my family moved here from [location] in 1985, I was 4. So
P14: yeah, it's it's been a while. I guess that's now 40 years. I didn't think about that until now.
S: Okay, all right.
P14: And how do you feel about the air quality in Bakersfield and San Joaquin Valley? Because, you know, you have worked in multiple cities around Bakersfield. So I think you're the
S: one of the people who could answer this question in an appropriate way.
P14: And how? How do I view it now? Or in the last 20-40 years that I know or.
S: I think it would be valuable if you have both perspectives and also the current air quality.
P14: Okay.
P14: As I was growing up in early. Well, the late eighties, before I was 10
P14: around that age, I remember things were
P14: very polluted. It wasn't as clean as it is now, just being able to look 40 miles to the mountains that we have. It was difficult to see the mountains.
P14: In the early nineties, same thing. They were starting to make changes. I remember laws were passed even about smoking, even about pollution. Things like that different.
P14: Different plans were in place here in California that people took advantage of like the cash for clunkers
P14: where people turned in their vehicles. That would, you know, wouldn't run as clean.
P14: I think different initiatives like that really helped.
P14: In the last 20 years I've seen a lot more cleanliness in the air.
P14: We're able to experience things differently than it was for the 1st 20 years that I've lived here
P14: I have noticed that more people are concerned. Now, now it seems to be odd when a vehicle is smoking at a stoplight, when before it was normal.
P14: And I think that going to different areas, going to Mojave. Once we get past the mountains here to Hatch range.
P14: everything is a lot more clear.
P14: But for all of us that are stuck here, we not only have, like the rain shadow effect from the mountains, but everything just gets trapped in the valley. It seems
P14: so. That's another reason why they've been really pushing for having clean air, because it just kind of just gets trapped and it stays here. But it's gotten a lot better.
S: Maybe the recent heavy rain helped calm down the dust and.
P14: Yes.
S: To grow.
P14: Yes, and that really is a big part of it, because I think that as
P14: when I was growing up we had a lot more fog in the area because there was probably less populated areas. And there are more fields now, with more population, more housing.
P14: We don't have as much fog anymore. But now we have more cars. If everything is being controlled, you can really tell the difference once it rains, just how everything clears up, and
P14: you just you can feel it. You can, I want to say, taste the difference, too.
P14: and simply just being able to spot or look out to the mountains. You really can't tell the difference from one day to another.
S: Okay? So in what ways does air quality affect your daily life at your work or your home?
P14: So for me, air quality is something that I consider if we are going to be spending time outside. So we are planning on having
P14: an activity here at work where we are gonna involve people outside. It's not just temperatures, because it's Bakersfield in [County name] County, but it's also air quality
P14: whenever there are fires or anything in the area. You know, those are things that we also have to consider because it just comes. And it just kind of just stagnates. It. Just kind of hangs over us here.
S: Hmm.
P14: So we plan, or we try to plan activities where we are going to be outdoors around definitely, not when it's fire season, when it's going to be more, you know. Clear, cleaner, spring rain definitely clears things up, offers better temperatures for us.
P14: At home. It's just maintaining that air filter whenever for the air conditioning. Whenever we do have
P14: fires in the area, or anything like that.
P14: you can really tell. And it just starts to clog things up a little more.
S: Hmm, so do you take any actions to deal with the challenges from the air quality issues.
P14: I do. I've started to make sure that the house my house windows are sealed, that there's anything that needs to be addressed. I take a look at weather stripping things like that and making sure that my air filter is
P14: not where it's starting to really strain the system, but try and get ahead of it.
P14: Outdoor activities. Same thing. If it's ugly, I tell you know I have younger brothers, and I tell them you know, let's not go outside, and let's not spend that much time outside.
S: Have you noticed any impact of air quality
S: to the people around you, including your family or your colleagues?
P14: I have. This is something that living here in the valley we have become familiar with. You know we have
P14: sinuses, we have pollen. We have everything that we have to deal with, but once you get out of the area you go to the coast, it just frees up, you know a lot of people that I know they are ready for retirement, and people that have retired. They want to move. They want to move their family out of here, and they tell me, you know, once I got out of here.
P14: the asthma just clears up a lot better. The sinuses, you know, clear up, and we associate it to everything that the air quality, everything that's just kind of circling and sticking, sticking around in the area.
S: I found some people moving their family to Tetchupi from Bakersfield.
P14: Yes.
S: Because of the asthma issue, and
S: I also moved to [Location] because of the asthma
S: of my younger one. She's now X years old.
S: and it was not good when she when we
S: 1st moved to Bakersfield when she was like X months.
S: Okay, regarding the air quality there are sometime the air quality is really bad.
S: like a dusty, windy day.
S: So have you ever shared some personal or family concerns?
S: around air quality issues with your colleagues?
P14: Yes, you know, this is something that I normally talk about. Looking back in the last 15-20 years, I used to be into bicycling.
P14: I used to be into road cycling.
P14: and that's one of those activities where you're out there and doesn't matter if the air quality is good or bad. We like riding, so we just cover up.
P14: But you struggle more, and you know that's one thing that my mom would always tell me, you know. Don't go out there. If the air quality is bad.
P14: I'd come back to work. I'd tell my coworkers, hey, you know, it's really ugly out there. It's gotten, you know, pretty heavy with stuff, and
P14: everybody agrees because we're pretty familiar with it. If you work here, if you work in the valley, you're pretty familiar with how bad the air quality is. It just seems like some days it just goes higher, and it just kind of stays and sticks for a few more days.
S: So you're saying that talking about air quality with the colleagues or other friends is kind of normal kind of topics.
S: Yeah, okay, so can you share any examples
S: when you shared these experiences with your colleagues.
P14: Colleagues as far as work related. Because I'm in safety, and I have to make sure that
P14: we're putting out topical information for the new hires for the employees that are here. And again, even though we work indoors, we try and make it so that it's not just the information here at work, but information that they can take home.
P14: I do newsletters every every
P14: 4 months. So I do those quarterly, and I usually put something in there about. You know, Pollen, you know, air quality. Aqi, being aware of that.
P14: Wearing Ppe personal protective equipment if you're outdoors and the air quality is bad.
P14: So I I normally do this every 3 or 4 months, but we're usually talking about it with our coworkers. Yes.
S: Hmm!
S: As 
S: your responsibility is to make a safe workplace.
S: Then I I bet you might have
S: Many incident where your colleagues shared their personal
S: or family concerns related to the air quality.
S: And can you share any examples of when your colleagues share their experiences
S: regarding the air quality with you.
P14: Yes, so whenever we have new hires, I we usually see them their 1st day. We welcome them. We try and get their information. So that we understand
P14: we, we can connect with them and then be able to understand each other better and build a relationship. When we have people coming in from out of the area. One thing that we tell them, aside from the heat.
P14: is just to be prepared for what it's like to be here in Bakersfield, and you know people will go to different means. They share with me that they will look into
P14: their kids having honey if they're babies so that they can become familiar with some of whatever's in the air out here, and they won't have allergies as bad, you know whether that's documented or not. People want to feel comfortable with their families here, and
P14: they will ask, Is it always like this? And I don't know what they mean, because we're so familiar with it.
P14: I said, you can't see the mountains sometimes it's just hazy. It's just ugly.
P14: Yeah, that's our air quality. We normally check this. And and this is not just one person. It's normally different people that move into the area that are surprised to see this
P14: in our area.
S: So mostly people just came to Bakersfield from other area.
S: Share the concerns with you.
P14: Yes, yeah, they're very, very open about bringing that up.
S: Okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I have one question. Do you know
Sung Hyoun Hong: do you know of any cases where people who remain in belly experienced, kind of like severe disruption to their daily lives or professional lives, due to the air quality?
P14: Lately. It it has. I've heard of it less.
P14: but I'm Hispanic and I talk to a lot of people that work in the fields. Agriculture is very big here and
P14: now
P14: the great thing about California is that we're trying to make more regulations, and we're trying to make sure that we are more prepared
P14: to look out for the employees. But there were times where employees that were out in the heat, and then, on top of that bad air quality. They would struggle, they would struggle, and they would have medical issues, complications
P14: to the point where they wanted to move their families up north to a different area somewhere out of here.
P14: But yes, it's it.
P14: People that work in the field. They have
P14: different access to medical treatment, and sometimes it's easy to associate better quality
P14: with them, not being able to breathe properly their asthma or anything else that they have happening
P14: again. This was more common 20 years ago, 15-20 years ago, than it is now, and how I've become.
P14: I've worked more office away from that. I still hear people say.
P14: but I don't hear it as often as it was before.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Just one more question. Have you seen any cases where someone deal with those
Sung Hyoun Hong: like challenges in a smart way? I mean have you ever seen any cases where people manage those challenges
Sung Hyoun Hong: in like more like more smart ways, or something like that? Or in clever way.
P14: Yes, I would say that people that really are concerned with air quality.
P14: We'll look into air purifiers
P14: or inside their homes. They will look into air purifiers for their workstations. Things like that, whether it's something that they just feel more comfortable having, and it puts them at ease or not.
P14: But there are also people that look into vehicles that have Hepa filters to some sort of just air filtration system.
P14: Mercedes, I know, makes a few. There are a few other things out there like that, and people that really do care about it. They go out of their way to find those ways.
P14: Like, I said. The new hires they reach out to me and they say, Hey, can I bring this for work? Because I want to make sure that I can keep my area to a certain point.
P14: So yeah, there are certain things that people are doing like that with their filters.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Impressive. Thank you.
P14: Yes.
S: And now we would like to shift gear. How we could overcome this bad air quality issue, and we just wanted to find some some positive effect
S: when we, you know, resolve these challenges together.
S: So sometimes people feel connected with others when facing common challenges, like dealing with air quality or dealing with, you know, a wildfire.
S: and in Bakersfield we have a consistent, you know, air quality challenges for everyone. So how did you feel about sharing these common challenges on air quality with your colleagues.
P14: Me, bringing them up to my coworkers and speaking about it, you mean.
S: Yeah. And also if people share their concern about the air quality with you.
P14: Oh, absolutely yes, yes, they do. We do
P14: as the temperatures drop in the winter. Here we see a lot more older houses that still have fireplaces.
P14: And that's another thing that employees, coworkers, people, will communicate with me. They say. You know.
P14: either they wish their house still had the old fireplace, or people will just flat out say that I don't care whether or not we have, it's a burn day. I'm still going to burn.
P14: and to me it's all of those things. I understand that you want the comfort you understand. I understand you want your fireplace. But
P14: now, going against these regulations that we have in place, it is going to affect it. So one person does it, and everybody else in the neighborhood doesn't, you know? Little by little all of that I feel that it has an effect, and people voice that to me
P14: I talk to people about that
P14: again. Another Hispanic thing that we do is we do bonfires
P14: and things like that, or even, you know, controlled burns to get rid of when there's cleanup.
P14: And all of those things are things that people talk to me. And you know we talked about different things.
P14: some people that still remember the cash for Plunkers. They think that was a good idea, and they think that should come back. I know that smog regulations here in California are also very, very big. I hear people complaining about
P14: having to do their smog check. And that's another thing. And I like discussing that with them, because I can always tell them. Hey.
P14: it was different in the eighties and nineties, you know, here in California, here
P14: in San Joaquin Valley, it was getting pretty pretty bad. So whatever it is that we're doing. I think that more people are concerned. I like to see that concern actually turning into changes and having a positive effect into it. But it's definitely something that people do talk about more.
S: So while you talk about this common challenges.
S: do you feel some sense of connectedness or a sense of connection with the people around you
S: like your colleagues or your friend.
P14: I do. And one connection that I have people that remember how things were.
P14: And that's nice, because we can.
P14: We can understand each other with them.
P14: When I hear younger people that moved here or are not familiar with it.
P14: I can connect with the fact that they lived in a nice area. They lived by the coast, but they chose to come here, and now they're complaining. Oh, it's not the same way that it was, or how it was where they were. No, it's not, but I can open up and say, you know, it's not as bad as it was either, so we do tend to talk about that. It is a common
P14: topic that comes up, and it's often seen in a positive, and I like to find the positive in that as well
P14: that we are moving forward. I think.
S: So you just shared that you feel some sense of connection with the people around you, when you guys talk about some
S: air quality issue that you guys are commonly experiencing.
S: And if you feel this sense of connection, how are those that affect you in terms of your perspective viewing the environment, or in terms of you know.
S: behaviors you are having in your organization.
P14: Well.
P14: for me. I've had multiple jobs. I've had jobs where I was outdoors. I was a mail carrier. I worked at the census bureau for temporary time.
P14: I I've talked to a lot of people in different businesses. I've worked indoors and
P14: and to me at my age at 43 right now. I never really associated it with the social responsibility that there is now
P14: so working in different places really has shown me that worked at home depot, and they do have initiatives that they have out there, you know, here at the court.
P14: There's different people that bring up, you know, even like recycling ideas, but commuting. And then things like that which do
P14: affect or have an effect on the air quality.
P14: there's more that can be done. But currently at a government agency, I mean.
P14: there's only so much that we can do here without it coming from administration and then just being filtered down to us.
P14: But I do think that, being aware, and
P14: at least through our employees, through our safety newsletters that I can provide, I think that does make an effect, and that does
P14: bring out information to the employees, just if it's reminders for themselves, for their own safety, for best practices at home, and things like that.
S: So. You said you are providing a brochure or flyer regularly,
S: that contains some information or knowledge about the air. About you know.
S: facing the air quality issues. But besides that,
S: how does your organization deal with the air quality issues?
S: There could be like providing masks, or providing, you know, additional air purification, or
S: maybe planting trees around your neighbor.
P14: So the way that we operate here at the courthouse for the company that I work with. Now
P14: we are looking at. Whenever there's vehicle purchases
P14: for fleet vehicles, and they are looking for something that's going to be low impact. Now, we aren't going electric vehicles yet. They did purchase
P14: 2 electrical vehicles that are just for the grounds.
P14: And that was used, that was a part of a green initiative that they were doing
P14: so that part is nice to see
P14: as far as any other involvement the court does not participate in actively in
P14: planting trees, or being a part of any walks because of the appearance of impropriety.
P14: We don't want to favor an organization that might come through
P14: our courthouse where somebody else is suing somebody else. So we have to be very careful with that.
P14: But yeah, and being able to see the
P14: on the grounds, there are some solar panels that have been done as well. So it's kind of a push for some people with, you know us consuming less and being a lot more cleaner. Here we do lease our vehicles from [county name] county.
P14: and we do lease our buildings from [county name] county, and
P14: you know, as far as air filters, especially when the COVID-19 was happening. That's when it really put that into my mind about the the nerve levels of the filters that need to be
P14: selected and used.
S: So
S: can you please share your thoughts on your organization's effort addressing air quality issues, you could have some satisfaction and also dissatisfaction. But I just wanted to know your general thought on their effort addressing air quality.
P14: I think that with us. I'm very neutral on it, because our actions are neutral ideally. It would be best if we took more action towards it, I would feel better at it about it. I'm sure my coworkers would also agree. But we're limited as far as
P14: what actions we can take.
P14: But anytime that there's any activity outdoors. If the air quality is bad, you know we are communicating with the boys. I think communication and information is one of the biggest things that we can provide for them. The second thing that we can do it's going to be just any gear that we can do like you mentioned
P14: any mask, filtration or anything like that.
P14: So whenever things are bad with the Aqi, that's when we really pay attention. We start to push that out a little bit more.
P14: There's always more that can be done, I think. But at this point I feel pretty good, because we're mostly indoors. And
P14: our involvement, it's
P14: it has to be directed through the administrators. But yeah, I feel like we're doing our part.
S: Okay, so there might be some employees.
S: Their idea about staying in this
S: community or sun. Hawking Valley might be changed, based on the organization's effort, on, you know, addressing the air quality issue.
S: Do you have? Do you had experience any of the
S: things that is related to that, you know.
S: topic.
P14: I haven't heard anybody specifically complain or praise us, the Court, for our efforts or for our non efforts on that. So no, I'm not too familiar with.
S: Okay, thank you.
S: And we would like to know how organization can support employees to handle the air quality issue.
S: And as a
S: safety manager in your organization. What support or additional effort do you think the organization could do
S: to address the air quality issues.
P14: Well at different levels. I think that we can do different things. Here, on an individual level. One thing that we could do which would be costly. Is going?
P14: Yeah.
P14: And initiating where in every area is going to have filtration systems for cleaner air that would be costly. And our easiest option. Our 1st option to do is to go through who we lease our buildings to ensure that we are not just at the levels, but possibly getting a little above that. That would be the 1st thing. I still think that communication
P14: passing along information is going to be very helpful, so whenever there are any initiatives, whenever there are programs, whenever there are
P14: events where they focus around air quality improvements, I think that would be good to pass along to making sure that we also create that separation. You know this is not sponsored by the court, but you're more than welcome to participate, or, you know, be part of it. I think that would be very, very big and helpful and useful here.
P14: So just gathering more information, passing it along.
S: Thank you. And with the current quality, air quality issues. Do you see yourself continuing to live and work
S: Bakersfield for long term?
P14: Long term for me.
P14: Would be until my retirement age. So I'm looking. I am considering about 7 more years here.
P14: At that point I would like to leave
P14: [county name] County and move to a different area. I'm still having still haven't decided on where?
P14: But yeah, that would. One of the reasons would be the air, quality, and hearing set fucking values.
S: Okay, thank you.
S: And is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with air, quality and community connections in San Joaquin Valley that we haven't discussed. And this is the last question.
P14: Okay. Thank you for that opportunity.
P14: I think that
P14: it seems to be one of the things here in in San Joaquin Valley that as it gets brought up, you start to hear about it more.
P14: So I think that overall of the community can really focus on putting that message out there.
P14: The CSR is really something that people surprising to me because I didn't grow up like that. People really do care about it.
P14: and it is nice to be able to see that it's nice to be able to push it.
P14: I haven't met somebody yet that would not take a job because the company CSR levels aren't where they feel comfortable with,
P14: but I think that we are headed that way. So we can also make continue to make improvements, and show that
P14: other people are more willing to be on board with it too.
S: Hmm, okay, thank you very much.
S: song. Yan, do you have any questions.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, I actually have 2 more questions.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, has your perspective on air quality issue in San Joaquin Valley ever changee it while living in those area.
Sung Hyoun Hong: like.
P14: It certainly improved. I really did think that it was normal for things to be that ugly back in the eighties and nineties, and I always thought, it's only going to get worse, but it certainly has improved. We've gotten to a point where it is a lot better people care, and the fact that we talk about it also means something.
S: Hmm.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Were there any something specific incidents, or like, like, you know, experience that
Sung Hyoun Hong: has changed your mind or change your perspective?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Do you have like specific incidents or events, or something like that, or communication.
P14: One thing that I can think of is, I still remember here in town when I was much younger.
P14: and we would go to a simple restaurant, even if it was just fast food like Mcdonald's, and we had smoking and non-smoking areas that were not separated by anything. It was just a sign that would keep one area from the other.
P14: The fact that smoking has become less. I think that's part
P14: of even our air quality just where we are, where we centralize ourselves to.
P14: I remember convenience stores. They stopped selling cigarettes. I think things like that. Those are all actions where people started moving away from the habits that we used to have, and moving forward towards thinking at least in the surrounding area with me. My family, you know I'm going to have. I'm going to look for and search for
P14: cleaner air.
P14: So I do see things like that. So that's what comes to mind right now.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thank you for sharing. One last question is, I know that dealing with challenges from air quality is obviously tough.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So that being said, I think this question is a little bit
Sung Hyoun Hong: weird. But do you think there is any upside or positive side for
Sung Hyoun Hong: having some common challenges with people around you?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Or have you ever experienced some positive, you know.
Sung Hyoun Hong: like common sense, or like connectedness, or something like that?
P14: The 1st part, I think you asked about challenges. Right? Yeah, and I think challenges are important. I think it really is important for people to have different perspectives. Because, again, if everybody thinks that things are great, we're less likely to move forward with change. So I think it's important for people to have varying different opinions, because
P14: again I I grew up a certain way. I know what it's like, and it's even though it's better. I still want to be able to see that. So I think that having the different perspectives and really communicating that is, really push more for them.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, this is all for me, and thank you for being here. And it was super helpful to get more sense of your area. Thank you, David.
P14: You're welcome.
S: Thank you, David, so we are pursuing this interview for additional, I think 30 people more.
S: So it would be grateful if you can recommend your colleagues, who are, who is also concerned with the air quality issues so that we can, you know.
S: improve our our community, our Bakersfield, and make our community
S: like the place where people want to live. So I know our community is heavily based on Hispanic ethnic group.
S: and I wish we can create
S: a place where our Hispanic community can live and work in a healthy environment. So I just wanted to provide some small piece of the contribution toward that direction. So.
S: yeah, if you have any colleagues or clients or family members, please let us know. Let me know. Then we would like to proceed the same
S: interview with them.
P14: Okay, sounds good. I understand that sometimes people aren't that willing to be interviewed?
P14: Just so, you know, Dr. Pak, I did bring it up in my
P14: I'm a member of the [Professional association name]. Assp.
P14: I did bring it up last week on the second we had our meeting, and I stuck around. I stuck around to see if anybody there were any takers, but unfortunately I wasn't able to get anybody, but I am trying so.
S: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
P14: Sure thing is this one last question, or one question on my end? Is this something that maybe we could talk to [Professor name] as well, and possibly bring up, and I don't know how much what your timeline is, but we have our next [county name] county SHRM meeting on April or May 7th. Would that be too late? Or would that be something.
S: Oh, yeah, I think that's a good idea. Maybe I can contact [Professor name] directly about this opportunity.
