P1: Yeah, definitely, basically, during my working days I just have to just get up. Then get some stuff done. Then I have to just be in my working environment and step out of in my working environment and my working day. And I spend a lot of times with my people. And I'm also, during my non-working day or my flexible hours, I try to go my normal agricultural process. I'm trying to some stuff done. So. It's actually always a busy day for me.
J: Okay. And then anything about your non work activities that you want to mention before we move on?

J: Yeah, I can hear you.
P1: Yeah, so basically that basically that that's just what it it means. It entails.
J: Yeah. So in Bakersfield, right? In the San Joaquin Valley?
P1: Yeah.
J: Okay. So for your family and living situation, could you tell me a bit about your family, and who you live with?
P1: Yeah, currently with my my wife, my my kids and I have my, my mom staying around also. And yeah, so actually living in sufficient. And that's definitely that.
J: Okay. And so about your connection to the San Joaquin Valley. So how long have you lived in the San Joaquin Valley? And what brought you here?
P1: Yeah, family. I've been there about this about my 8 years, plus yeah. It's about family, about actually,
P1: came for experiences. And I got family and had to move some of them down also.
P1: And the experiences has been cool. That's been wonderful nice community events, nice place and welcoming.
J: Okay.
J: So for Section 3, the environmental experiences and perceptions. So about your thoughts on the air quality, how do you feel about the air quality in the San Joaquin Valley?
P1: Yeah. You want to talk about, especially the weather condition. If you want to start there. I think a normal weather condition, especially during the winter period, especially during the summer period. It's quite quite timid and basically very low.
P1: And if you want to talk about the the, the, the what we call the air pollution and the the activities. I feel. a lot of activities. Work work against. The the quality of air. Because of like, I said. I think San is in a kind of agricultural interested environment which have a lot of activities which this brings a lot about
P1: pollution, especially because of the fertilizers that are used because of the because of the the chemicals that I used, and especially the roots on the roads of has a lot of heavyweight trucks, movements, Diesel, and so it brings a lot about pollution and making the air quality not quite quite cool. And so I think
P1: it's it's it's not really. It's not really, it's not really lovely at that point, because but I try to understand, because this is an agricultural heritage, environment and
P1: and also it gives our opportunity to to, to appreciate nature.
J: Right. Okay. So
J: yeah, that's that's good insights. So as far as your impact on your daily life, in what days does the air quality affect your daily life at work and home? So like outdoor activities, you kind of touched on it earlier. But what? How does the air quality affect what you do?
P1: Yeah, a whole lot, a whole lot. Especially my walking activities. And everybody wants everybody wants a nice working environment. Everybody wants a nice working experience, and especially having to especially, let me say, during the winter period. It's actually quite chill. And looking at how timid. It is now, talking about the pollution itself, it gives
P1: kind of. And is this a situation where you have to have some difficulty in breeding some difficulty in inhaling some some substance which is not quite healthy to the, to the system, and you have to be quite quite careful trying to cover your nose, trying to cover what you take in. And so normally, it's kind of it's kind of bugging. It's kind of it's kind of difficult, but just we call.
J: Yeah.
J: okay, so that's how it affects you. And then so as far as your observations of impact on others, so have you noticed its impact on others around you?
P1: Yeah, definitely like, like, you asked about my work flexibility and my communication levels with my workers. So I feel we talk a lot about this. And I think I came to realize that we share multiple understanding multiple consent, having the same experiences. So I think it's not really cool also with them. And I think we talk about about it, especially the activities that goes on. So I think it's the same. It's mutual.
J: Okay. And then, as far as your family goes, so how do the concerns about your family's health? I know you said you have a wife. Your mom lives with you. You have kids. So how do those concerns about your family's health influence your feelings?
P1: Yeah. Like, I said, we just we just have to understand, because before moving here, we we understood the the terrain. We understood the environment. And and so we just came to appreciate nature and
P1: So we understand that most of the times it's not actually clean. Anyway, we have. Most of them are natural. And so, looking at the dust storms, looking at the wildfires, most of them are just what you can actually have anyway, and everywhere. So we try as much as to protect ourselves from it, and just to take precautionary motives and using the necessary tools like when it's that damped when it's that bad, and just to stay just alive.
J: Yeah.
J: Okay, so as far as the community connection and identity, do you think experiencing air pollution with others like you mentioned your coworkers earlier. So do you think experiencing the air pollution with others strengthens your sense of connectedness in your organization?
P1: Yeah. Definitely given the opportunity to talk about it gives an opportunity to share experiences. It brings a lot of connectivity, a whole lot.
J: Okay. And then how do you feel when others share similar experiences related to air pollution with you?
P1: Yeah, it gives gives me a sense of belonging. And actually, I feel if we if I wanted to do something about it, or to actually help our own particular environment. Then I have people of like minds, people that think the way I do. And yeah. So I feel I'm working in a place that actually people understand and feel the same way, the same energy.
J: Okay. And the second section. So identity, fusion, explanation. Sometimes people feel a strong bond with others when facing common challenges like dealing with air quality. How did you feel when you shared experiences about air quality with your colleagues?
P1: Yeah, this one of things that is actually quite natural. And most of the times. You you don't, you don't. There's nothing to mix world with. It's it's what everybody's experiencing. And so I feel it's mutual consent, mutual agreement, mutual discussion.
P1: So most of the times we just feel relaxed, talking about it and looking forward way forward, and especially looking at the agricultural processes and the agricultural system here, because I think the people in south here. I think they love tomatoes. They do a lot of grapes, and so I feel they have a needs for all these chemicals to help them grow their product.
P1: And so when I'm talking with my colleague, it gives me this sense of trying to look for the possible solution, the possible ways to actually see how to reduce, and this effect in the society in our air, and also so I'm talking to my colleagues. Give me this sense of belonging gives me this much well understanding with them, and brings us to the common agreement, and looking for the possible way forward.
J: Right, okay. So as far as influence on thoughts and behaviors, how has this sense of bond affected your thoughts, feelings, or actions toward your organization?
P1: Yeah, I actually actually see beyond just my work. I see beyond just what I was employed to do. I actually see how to actually help and affect my my society, my my environment, my working space.
P1: And so if I actually have a possible solution to how I solve my own personal issue. I think I bring it up, and I actually up to your help in a particular point, and it gives me opportunity to bring discussions to the table even with the management, and gives an opportunity to relate with the top management, and to see how the possible, how possible ways to grow the organization.
P1: So it actually gives. Give me an opportunity to bring up a discussion and to bring a positive effect.
J: Okay, so as far as personal vulnerability and sharing experiences go, have you ever shared personal or family vulnerabilities related to air quality with your colleagues or coworkers? And if so,
J: how was it received? And how did it affect your connection with them?
P1: Yeah, like, I said, it's 1 of the most sincere topic we actually talk about, because it's what everybody experience. And so I actually shared a lot with them, and how they cope, and what they do, and how they feel. And so I think they actually share the same. And most of them actually same experiences. And so it's always multiple.
J: Okay.
J: So for personal and collective actions.
J: Personal actions to cope with poor air quality. What actions, if any, have you taken to deal with the challenges of air quality?
P1: Yeah,
P1: basically. Like, I said, 1st of all, you try to think of surviving. You try to think of yourself possible things to do, especially when you find yourself in a place where it's actually quite much. You try as much to look for a mask just to cover your nose as at a point. So you don't inhale a lot of stuffs.
P1: and you try as much people to do same to people around you, and to advise them to talk about it. And also there are times you don't have to just open all your windows. You don't have to open all your doors, and because I think it's safer required inside, because there are periods where these chemicals are being sprayed because of agricultural activities. And so you try as much as possible to avoid where heavy trucks or heavy loaded equipment are, especially in the highways.
P1: and because of the the fusions and the rest. So you try as much people to stay in a safer, safer environment. And also you help people also around you to take precautionary motives. And concerning this.
J: Okay. And then, so that's good. So personal, protective measures for you with the mask and everything. So how do those around you cope with bad air quality? Do they do the same thing with the masks, or do they do something different?
P1: Yeah, actually, it works for me. So I introduce it to them and and also they actually take the same motives. And also actually avoiding, like, I said, places where these fumes are actually transmitted, and also limiting, most of them actually use of public transport or kapo, and also to drive electric or hybrid vehicles, which is quite advisable. And also I also talk to them about
P1: how to maintain their vehicles, also because a lot of this pollution actually comes out from the fumes, from even their personal cars. And so, if your engine is healthy, you have less of this, and so actually talk to them about it, and also to reduce some energy consumption and actually make use of a lot of recycle and compost. So I'm transport to see how to help them in all these areas.
J: Okay.
J: So as far as organizational efforts go, how is your organization helping employees to overcome air quality issues?
P1: Yeah, like, our top management do talk about it a lot especially, and they try to advocate for clean energy policies.
P1: Also, they try as much as possible to support sustainable agriculture, just to promote and purchase products from local sustainable farms and trying to reduce much of chemical use on our products. And so they actually talk to us about it. They actually have meetings. They actually educate us on how to go about all this. So I think they're working in the same purpose of eradicating
P1: a lot of chemicals in our air.
J: Okay. And it sounds like you're pretty positive about the organization's actions. But what do you think about your organization's actions?
P1: Yeah, I think it's quite positive. It's quite positive. Yeah, it's quite positive, because they are seen in the same direction and trying to push the same goal and try to eradicate this harmful substance.
J: Okay. So as far as impact of actions on your perspectives, has support from your organization changed your perspective on air quality issues?
P1: Yeah, it gives me hope. It gives me a lot of hope. So I feel as long as something steps is being taken. I think we are moving towards a good direction.
J: Okay, sounds good and does support from your organization strengthen your connection to the organization?
P1: Definitely. I love to work in a place that is quite positive. So I think they give me a positive mentality. So it works for me.
J: Okay. So that's the way that it strengthens. Your connection is that it gives you a more positive mentality.
P1: Definitely.
J: Okay. And as far as future perspectives and aspirations or long term plans, do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area long term? I know you've already lived here and worked here for 8 years, you said previously. But do you think that you'll live and work in this area longer? And why or why not? Or do you have plans to move?
P1: Quite positive. I feel I would really say I'm looking at staying for some time, and I'm not in a hurry to leave, because I think I actually value their cultural experiences. Talking about the agricultural heritage like I said, and the cultural diversity and also
P1: in my personal growth. I think I have a lot of new skills since I came here, and I think I have opportunity also to appreciate nature, because I personally, I love water-based environments. So I actually have opportunity to stay around such environment and talking about their relaxation and
P1: rejuvenation. I think it's a sense of calm and relaxation from spending time in the peaceful countryside. And so it gives me a lot of time to think, and also so I think I'm not actually in a Hurst to leave, because I think I have a lot to contribute in the nearest future, especially to the development and improvement of the A.
J: Okay. And so, as far as your hopes for environmental improvement go, imagine the air quality is significantly improved. How do you think that would affect your life and your connection to the community?
P1: I think that would be paradise here on Earth. That would be quite better. That's quite better. And that's what we are actually hoping for.
J: Right. Okay. And then some, a few more questions, and then we'll close so
J: as far as desired support. So what potential factors can make people leave the San Joaquin Valley? So example, lack of advice from friends, personal efforts, corporate support, and green initiatives. So
J: what factors can make people leave the San Joaquin Valley? Do you think?
P1: I think if nothing is really done about eradicating or actually bringing to a low this issue, I think it will. Actually, I can actually push people from actually leaving for their safety. And also, I feel if a lot of advices, a lot of instructors, a lot of cautions, precautions also not taken. I think it's actually going to push people. Because, like I said in my working environment, if you imagine
P1: someone like me have opportunity to be sharing my experiences with a lot of people. And if I can actually be having a negative experience, then I've been sharing it to people, and I think it might actually discourage a lot of people, and so but I try to show more light on the positive side of it, and allowing them to see what comes in the nearest future. So I think if these things are not really put in place, I think it will actually cause a lot of people to move out.
J: Right. Okay.
J: And so on the flip side of that. So that's what can make people leave the San Joaquin Valley. What potential factors can make people stay in the San Joaquin Valley?
P1: Yeah, as long as we keep on admiring the beautiful nature as long as we keep admiring the push they have, especially in their agriculture and the new skills. Like, I said, giving us experiences every day. And I think people actually want to deal towards it and to actually develop themselves also.
J: Okay. And then, as far as the closing question goes, for your additional thoughts, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with air quality and community connections in the San Joaquin Valley that we haven't discussed?
P1: Yeah, basically, I think we've really talked about basically everything. And also to know, I think the sun has actually invested a lot in renewable energy sources, such as the solar, such as the wind power, and just to reduce the carbon footprint. And that's a whole lot of hope. And so I just believe people should actually choose toward the direction, because a lot of good, positive things actually happening.
J: Okay, yeah, absolutely. So
J: that will conclude our interview. And then you should be receiving the Amazon gift card within 48 h.
P1: Alright, that's cool.
P1: That sound good, that's good. Thank you. I appreciate.
J: Alright! I appreciate your time, P1. Thanks for talking to me today.
P1: Alright, I appreciate. Have a nice, beautiful day.
P1: Alright! You, too.
