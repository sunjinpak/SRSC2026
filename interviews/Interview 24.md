# Interview 24

## Transcript
P24: Let me see.
P24: Can you hear me?
P24: Hi! How are you.
S: Hello, Joanna! How are you?
P24: Good! How are you nice to see you again.
S: Good to see you.
P24: Yes.
S: Yeah. How's your new life with your baby?
P24: He? It's it's going good! He's growing. He's 7 months now.
S: 7 months!
P24: Yes.
S: Times fly really fast.
P24: Yeah, I don't know if you could see.
S: Oh, yeah, but he.
P24: Going.
S: It's a right mix with, you know, [Participant 24’s partner], and you.
P24: Yes.
S: Goes. What is his name?
P24: Jacob.
S: Jacob.
S: Well, I would like to see him in face to face if I have a good opportunity later.
P24: Yes, of course, we'll definitely have to visit.
S: Okay, thank you very much for joining this interview as well.
S: So I just wanted to introduce SungHyoun Hong from Georgia State University.
P24: Hi!
Sung Hyoun Hong: Hello!
S: And we are conducting this research to see how air quality in Kern County impact employees motivation in Kern County as well.
P24: Okay.
S: So actually, this reflects my experience.
S: I first moved to Bakersfield in 2022 with my third baby when she was 3 months
S: and she got an asthma during the during the first 6 months in the Bakersfield, and
S: we didn't have an other opportunity other than moving to
S: Santa Clarita, where I'm currently living because of the health issue.
S: And also I had some experience with the people when I share the air quality issue. 
S: But I was not comfortable with sharing this issue with
S: the colleagues, because, you know, I'm a new employee.
S: and I thought that those sharing might impact them to think of whether I'm
S: satisfied with this organization or not.
S: Because my satisfaction with this community directly relates to the job satisfaction.
S: and that would impact my reputation as well. So just wanted to see how this could generalize across employees in Kern County.
S: And yeah, so I thought, [Participant 24’s partner], and you are the perfect sample because you got a new family member and wanted to see whether that impact your perspective
S: of you know, of evaluating air quality around you.
S: So first, oh, so this interview will last around 45 min.
S: and after this interview, I will send you a $40 Amazon gift card, and this is supported by CSUB.
P24: Thank you.
S: Okay, so can you tell us about your current role in your job?
P24: Yeah. So currently, I'm an accountant, too. And I
P24: just basically help with the accounting of the company. So it's private accounting and everything with like payments and wires. So that's currently what I do, just accounting.
S: Okay. I always wonder what is accounting one and accounting two. Are there any counting three and four?
P24: There is accounting three. But currently in that in our company there isn't. It just depends on like the responsibilities and different access. So just that, yeah.
S: Okay, so it has more responsibility than accounting one.
P24: Yes. Correct.
S: Okay. Thank you very much.
P24: Of course.
S: So does your work requires physical presence?
P24: Yes.
S: So like.
P24: I mean, I can work remotely, but normally it's preferable to come into office.
S: Okay.
S: Great. Can you walk us through a typical day for you, including your work hours and after work hours?
P24: Yes, the typical day we wake up, get ready then go ahead and take my baby to my in-laws. Sorry some in the lunchroom. So take my baby to my in-laws, and then from there I'll go ahead and drive to work.
P24: Get to work like, start work at 8 am, and then
P24: do my normal responsibilities, and then get off about 5, go home, cook dinner, and then just relax with my family and then get ready for bed around
P24: let's say 9. Start our night routine so we could be in bed by 10, 10:30.
P24: Hmm.
S: After your work. Do you have any outdoor activity like running or jogging?
P24: We do. We do take our baby for a walk after. So sometimes we'll do go on a walk in our neighborhood, and or we'll work out. We do have a gym inside our garage, so we'll work out in there as well. But for the most part, like if we do go outdoors, there'll be like a walk out in the neighborhood.
S: Okay.
S: Have you ever checked your weather app to see whether the air quality is good or bad, and pick and choose which day you want to go out with your baby?
P24: I haven't really put much thought into it on that. But if I do see sometimes when the air quality is bad, I don't, really, I haven't really put too much thought into it.
S: Hmm. Okay.
S: Great. How long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley?
P24: About 5 years.
S: 5 years, and can I ask what brought you here.
P24: So I have family that lives up here North and I, we decide to move up here as well.
S: Oh, so your family lives in Bakersfield?
P24: So I have a sister who lives in Delano, and then a brother who lives in Fresno, and,
S: Oh, yeah.
P24: We decided to move up here because we we're familiar with the area. We're comfortable, and so more affordable.
P24: And that was a big factor as well.
S: So before you moved to Bakersfield, did you live that? Have you lived in? I mean Fresno.
P24: Prior to living to Bakersfield. We lived, like the Los Angeles County, around by the beach area so Long Beach. That's where I lived.
S: Oh, that's wonderful place!
P24: Yeah, really close, like a 5-minute drive to the beach.
S: Wow!
P24: Yeah.
S: How do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley? I know you're the right person, because you could compare the air quality between Long Beach and here.
P24: Yes, so I would definitely say that it's umm…I mean it is concerning now that I have a baby, it's it's, you know, if their quality sometimes
P24: it is, I do understand, it's like more lower air quality here. So it's concerning for my baby like you said he might be exposed to, you know, other diseases, or he can,
P24: or even ourselves. So that's very concerning. So I would definitely say, that's a very high concern.
S: so you lived in San Joaquin Valley for around 4 or 5 years. So has your perspective on the air quality issues changed during that time?
P24: It has now that I have a baby. So it's it's definitely
P24: I haven't really paid too much attention to it before, but now that I have a baby, it does definitely
P24: It is important to me to make sure my baby is safe.
P24: And so yeah, my perspective to home has changed.
S: Hmm!
S: Great.
P24: I'm so sorry.
S: No, no, no, I'm just passing the question.
P24: Yeah.
S: Sorry.
S: All right, and your baby does.
S: does not have significantly influenced by the air quality, though?
P24: I wouldn't say I can see any signs of any, yeah, as of right now, I don't think I see any signs.
P24: Okay.
S: And in what ways do air quality conditions around you affect your daily activities?
P24: I would say, air quality conditions, normally, I'm inside, so I wouldn't say it's too much of a high risk, but I know sometimes it can be transmitted indoors.
P24: So it, for the most part, like as you mentioned like, if I do go on a walk, that would be more I would be more exposed.
P24: But for the most part, I do stay indoors, and I'm not sure how that relates, oh, like if there's poor air quality inside.
P24: But when I do go outside, or when we go on a park or event, it is more, I'm more exposed.
S: Okay.
S: have you modified any work or personal activities due to air quality concerns? So I remember that there are some day with a heavy wind, there's a dust everywhere.
S: So or you know, there's high level of ozone level
S: when when it's really hot.
P24: Yes.
S: So the.
P24: Go ahead. Sorry.
S: Oh, that's just one example. But
S: would those kind of critical moment impact your work and personal activities.
P24: Yes. So when my baby was oh, recently a newborn, when there was like dust storms, we would cover him with like a muslin blanket, or especially like even where I will put a mask on, so we don't inhale or breathe any any dirt or
P24: pollution.
S: Hmm, okay, it was important day because you need to go to the hospital for the regular checkup.
S: So you could not, you know, skip that day.
P24: Yes, correct. So we we had to cover the baby, because I mean we had to, you know, go to the doctor. So it was important for us to make sure he was protected and covered.
S: Okay, have you considered moving other dates to meet with your daughter? Doctor.
P24: We we didn't at the time. We just it was a normal checkup. It was mandatory, so they had told us after they needed to see the baby a certain amount of time since he was a newborn, so we just said it was important. We'll go ahead and take him. But we didn't really change the date.
S: Okay, had air quality ever affected your work, productivity, or attendance?
S: Or your focus, or you know, attention?
P24: I wouldn't say that I necessarily would correlate it to that, but if it had, I wouldn't necessarily
P24: know other than like visible effects of like dirt and dust, you know,
P24: affecting breathing, but for the most part I don't think it has significantly affected my focus for my work, but I will say like, for example, my spouse, [Participant 24’s partner]. He he gets
P24: allergies so that affects him a lot, and then he will. He will start getting symptoms.
S: Hmm.
S: Okay.
S: So have you made any purchases or changes to your home or routine related to air quality? It could be, you know, buying air purifier, or changing the filter to a HEPA filter?
P24: We have not at this time, but we have considered buying an air purifier just to keep our home a little bit more clean and and pure. Yeah.
S: Okay.
P24: So we're definitely looking into that.
S: Yeah, okay, this research is about sensitivity of the air quality. And we know that the sensitivity of the air quality quite varies across people.
S: So it's totally normal that you are less aware about the air quality. So when we interview some people, they are super concerned about the air quality.
P24: Yeah. Go. Ahead. Sorry.
S: So your response is totally normal. So I think more than half of the people react like you.
P24: Okay, I know it's a topic that is very important. And I,
P24: for sure, I need to do more like research and understanding. And I haven't really taken much steps to change my lifestyle on
P24: improving air quality, but and it's it's an important.
P24: aspect of
P24: daily life.
S: All right. So let's
S: switch our focus to other people, how they deal with the air quality. So have you noticed that air quality impacts on others around you?
P24: Well, yes, for example, like my fiance, [Participant 24’s partner], he when whenever there's like, for example, if we go to a place where there's a lot of dirt. He needs to take an allergy pill prior to going to that place, or also start getting symptoms like he'll start coughing, or he he'll just start
P24: coughing, teary eyes. So that's one example that I've noticed, and then also my family, what, well, his his grandma also has suffers like from coughing. So is it very important for us when there is lower air quality that we're not exposing those family members, or they need to take, you know, like medicine or medication before we go to those places.
S: So when you have a family event with your, with [Participant 24’s partner] or other people, have you ever switched the date for the events because of the air quality concerns.
P24: Well, one example would be like our doctor's appointment. We did not switch the appointment, but if there, if it was case of where it was severe outside, like if it was a very, you know,
P24: strong air quality, I mean poor air quality, then we would definitely not go out. We would try to stay inside as much as possible or cover, but for the most part, when that does happen we try to not to go out.
S: Okay. Thank you.
P24: Of course.
S: So in the, in the organization we often talk about the hot weather with our peers and colleagues.
S: And also we often talk about the air quality concerns with our, you know, colleagues. So how comfortable are people in your workplace with discussing air quality concerns.
P24: I think they're very comfortable. Actually, a lot of people have air purifiers in their offices or in their cubicles. I think they would be open to discussing, and I do see visibly people do have air purifiers in their spaces.
S: So you think that it's quite natural to talk about this issue in your organization.
P24: I would say so. Yes.
S: I see.
S: Okay.
S: have you ever shared personal or family concerns, or related or issues related to air quality with your colleagues.
P24: No, not at this time, but I wouldn't. I wouldn't be opposed to sharing.
S: Yeah.
P24: Yes.
S: How about your colleagues? Have your colleagues shared their personal or family concerns or issues related to air quality with you?
P24: I wouldn't say so. No, not at this time. No.
S: Okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I'm just curious. Beyond just talking about how bad air quality is in general. Would you also feel comfortable discussing how negatively the air quality affects our daily lives and also our health?
P24: Would you say how comfortable I am sharing to my coworkers?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yes, and also yeah. And also
Sung Hyoun Hong: how comfortable your coworkers are sharing to you.
P24: Can you repeat the last part? How comfortable is…
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah the both, like, how comfortable, how you feel about the sharing the concerns, and also how they feel about sharing the concerns with you and other colleagues.
P24: I would say I'm comfortable with sharing
P24: this topic a hundred percent. Yes, I wouldn't. I would say. My coworkers as well. We're very pretty, communicative and transparent, so I would say they're pretty comfortable.
S: Hmm, okay. Have you ever wanted to take
S: wear a mask? But felt hesitant, due to some, you know. Peer pressures.
P24: Sometimes, yes, but for, when we do go out, and there is poor air quality. Oh, definitely, we do wear a mask, even though there is hesitation, you know
P24: for social norms, we don't want people to think there's something we're sick, but it is for our safety. So even though that does run across my mind, I still we will still put a mask on
P24: when there is
P24: air dust out. Yes.
S: So I also felt the same pressure like you. So
S: when I 1st park, my car at the CSUB parking lot, and when I wear the mask because I
S: thought, there's a heavy wind. So I was just worried about valley fever.
S: But I realized that I'm the only one who is concerned with the valley fever, because
S: I realize that I'm the only one who wore the mask.
P24: Yeah, no, definitely.
S: So I just wonder
S: why, we are having those kind of social pressure, even though we went through the Covid era
S: and we are so comfortable wearing masks. But still we are,
S: we have some pressure not to wear the mask.
P24: Yeah, definitely, I think it's just
P24: we don't want people to think that we're sick or something's wrong. So I think that's where, like our conscious
P24: you know, maybe says, Oh, we should wear the mask. But even though it is hard, or maybe we do have that social pressure when there is high air dust. We we just put the mask on, especially when we go to places like the Fair or when there's like the farm or something. You know, we definitely want to put that on, because then we'll get our nostrils will be with dirt, and then we'll get symptoms.
S: Yeah, I remember that during the 2023 pumpkin patch, I breathed so much dust.
S: and I didn't realize that there were so much dust, because it was. It was night.
P24: Yeah.
S: I have cough, keep coughing for two days after I visited that pumpkin patch.
P24: As of now you do. You wear your mask now, after?
S: Okay.
S: I forgot to bring my mask. I was too lazy.
P24: Yeah.
S: Okay,
S: So you said, you're quite comfortable.
S: discussing or sharing air quality concerns with your colleagues. I think that is also important, because sometimes, when we are on the same page that we are with the same difficulties, like same bad air quality, it doesn't applies who's rich or who's poor, it applies.
P24: Hmm.
S: You know, for all people.
P24: Yes, definitely.
S: Yeah. So I think that could
S: possibly make us some kind of sense of connection with others. So have you ever thought about some similar feelings of, you know, sense of connection with others. When you share some environment concerns with others.
P24: Can you? I'm sorry. Go ahead.
S: Have you ever felt about some connections with others? When you talk about, you know, environmental concerns, such as a heat wave or ozone level or air, quality or valley fever.
P24: Oh, yes, definitely. When we, when I speak to my coworkers, we definitely feel that sense of like connection like, Oh, like, I can't believe like this is happening. And you know, like that worry or that fear that you know,
P24: we can't really control, that the air quality is that way. But,
P24: You know, we're all in the same feeling of well, what can we do to make this better? How can we change things? So I definitely do see that resonance when I talk to my coworkers about these topics.
P24: yeah, definitely.
S: So you lived in Long Beach. So I think you might be the right person
S: how the discussion is quite different. You know, like,
S: you know, in Long Beach, there's not much like you know the experience, that people share about the concerns of air quality or other things, because from my perspective. Long Beach is one of the greatest places we can live.
P24: When you move to San Joaquin Valley, especially Bakersfield,
S: How do you think? How do you think the function of you know,
S: how? How do I say? Function of the bad air, quality or heat wave. How that applies to the relationship with others. Do you have any perspective on that.
P24: As far as relationship in Long Beach or my relationships now?
S: So you can just compare the discussions. The oh, yes, of course, and between two communities.
P24: Yeah. So, for example, like I used to work at like a cafe in Long Beach, and we would sometimes would be overcast and like, Oh, it's overcast today. And so that would like people would be happy. So I think the different conversations are definitely led in different places.
P24: So I would say, different feelings are different. Conversations in the different cities are are are
P24: a little different, but for the most part I would say that Long beach was, the air was more
P24: it would feel fresh because you're at the beach and like overcast or the rain so definitely the feelings when we would speak to the conversations that I would have when we would speak to other people
P24: about the concerns of air quality were were very different, and they were, I mean, I would say, shared same like mutual like when I speak to others. This shared concern, whether it was in Long Beach, or whether it wasn't here
P24: shared concern or shared joy, because in Long Beach is more. You know, we didn't really have a lot of conversation, I would say on for air quality.
P24: What I can remember.
S: Okay, okay.
S: Thank you. So do you think that starting the conversation with air quality, or hot hot weather? Do you think that that could
S: help the richer discussion of making people disclosing their their personal things more comfortable.
P24: Do I think I'm sorry? One more time.
S: Do you think that you know? Share sharing the so in Kern county,
S: Yeah, do you think that having a discussion around air quality concerns such as pollution or heat wave. Do you think those kind of discussion could help people disclose their other personal concerns?
P24: I would. I think so. I think definitely when one starts to be transparent or open somebody else may feel open to share their experiences. So I think definitely, if I open up and share my personal experiences when I speak with others that would open conversations, I definitely agree that that would help be helpful.
S: Okay, do you have
S: for any chance do you have any specific, you know, experiences that could represent that, you know that case?
P24: That taste, or what do you mean?
S: Case.
P24: Case case. Sorry for me personally, like, as far as work-related, when I have conversations at work
P24: specific to air quality, or just specific to opening up to others?
S: Air quality, or yeah, or hot weather.
P24: Yes, I would say, mostly hot weather, because, as I mentioned before, I haven't really put too much.
S: Hmm.
P24: Maybe attention to air quality. But now that we're having this discussion, I'll definitely
P24: be more aware. But, for example, like heatwise like, I've had conversations here in the office about heat, like oh, my goodness, it was hot, this weekend you know. What did you do? Or you know even people talk about like their bills racking up when it comes to like this time around. So we definitely have conversations on that that we've had here. Yes.
S: Great. Let me, let me look at the specific questions that could apply to your case.
S: Okay, so let's talk about the organizational effort. So we all know that our community, the air quality is not good. So what steps your organization can take address to
S: overcome this air quality issues?
P24: I would say definitely, being more like
P24: sending correspondence to employees conducting seminars and maybe providing incentives to, or providing air qualifier, air purifiers within
P24: cubicles or offices. So I would say in my organization, specifically, would probably speak to human resources and see how we can
P24: send correspondences, so that employees are aware and
P24: just engage and involve people and educate people on on this topic. 
P24: Like for example, my company, sorry, we we do like rent the University. So there's you know everybody's required to complete certain. Oh, go ahead! Do you have your hand up.
S: No, no, no.
P24: Sorry. I thought I saw someone's hand.
P24: So we're required to complete certain trainings. Maybe that would be like a requirement for for my company.
S: Oh, so for example, does your company has specific training session to talk about employees’ health
S: related to air quality.
P24: We do have a health trainings. I'm not sure if we have air quality help, but maybe we can add that on. If we would like to be, make everybody where, and all employees are required to complete that training.
S: Okay, okay.
P24: I mean, they do have a lot of trainings on health topics and safety. So I would imagine that maybe that would be something that we, they can add.
S: if your organization add those type of topic in the training session, what kind of feelings, you might have toward your organization.
P24: What kind of feelings.
S: Yes.
P24: I would say positive. I think anything that helps improve, you know awareness and health. I think that's a positive, because especially if it helps improve the
P24: health and safety of our family members of individuals. I think it's always good to be aware, and how we can improve
P24: for for to prevent any any health issues or to combat that. And just be more aware.
S: Okay, umm
S: Let's talk about the future perspectives. And considering the current air quality issues, do you see yourself continuing to live in Bakersfield or work in this area for long term.
P24: As of now, I mean we, me and my fiance just purchased a home, so as of now I wouldn't say we're moving, but in the future, I would say, we definitely need to consider
P24: maybe moving. But it is a hard, a hard.
S: Right.
P24: Thing, you know, like so as of now, I would say no, but I would definitely implement things that can help us, not prevent, but help us stay safe.
P24: But yeah.
S: For that for that opinion. Do you think that
S: air quality issues is the major factors that influences your decision?
P24: I would say, no, not necessarily like I mentioned earlier. The price range here in in where we live is a little bit more affordable. How similar to what we got down South is gonna be much more expensive.
P24: And so I don't think that's the only factor. But I think it is a big factor
P24: and also family. My family lives here, and and [Participant 24’s partner]'s family lives here.
S: There's a lot.
P24: Other factors that influence that decision.
S: Okay.
S: I also heard that from [Participant 24’s partner]. He's attending church here.
P24: Oh, yes, we're just here. So we have a community here.
S: Yeah, so.
P24: That's the.
S: I also attend church, and it's not easy to change the church.
P24: Yes. So it's that's another factor. That's kind of hard for us to consider of moving. If we were to move, it would be a hard decision.
S: So yeah.
S: to me, I feel like I would like to work at CSUB Bakersfield for long term, because I really like this area. And I really
S: experience the feelings of welcoming from the people in, you know, Bakersfield. So I just wanted to work here as much as I can. But the thing is the air quality. So that's why I embarked in
S: this study, in order to increase the awareness of the air quality, and in that way we can change the environment.
P24: Yes, definitely.
S: So that was my intention to start this research, and we got a
S: $10,000 grant to do this research.
P24: That’s amazing.
S: Yeah, that's amazing. So,
S: Joanna, if you have any family members or friends or church brothers and sisters who are working in Kern County, please, you know, spread out your word that we are looking for the interviewees.
P24: Of course.
S: Yeah, they could get $40 Amazon gift card right away.
P24: Of course, and I apologize for the noise I didn't expect I'm in the lunch room. So
P24: oh, I didn't.
P24: Is it okay. So.
S: I haven't heard any noise.
P24: Okay. Alright. Well, of course I would. Yeah, go ahead.
S: Okay. So yeah, and it was really nice to see you. And I hope you have a great day.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I'm sorry, but I know we have already covered this, but I have few more questions.
P24: Yes, of course.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: When I think back to the Covid period, I remember, people react really differently when I expressed some concern around the Covid, like
Sung Hyoun Hong: the most positive response, came from a friend who had actually gone through the Covid before, and they shared how bad it was for them, and showed genuine concern for me, and even offer some helpful suggestions and way to cope it. And on the Flip side other side, like some people brush it off like it wasn't, it was not a big deal, and
Sung Hyoun Hong: and they like, I will say they felt worse.
Sung Hyoun Hong: and some people seem even uncomfortable talking about how bad it is because it is out there. So in your case, maybe you you have a lot of good friend around you, which is a good thing. It sounds like you mostly hear supportive responses and positive reactions from your people like coworkers and friends. But I'm curious, could you share the most positive
Sung Hyoun Hong: and the most negative reactions you've received from your colleagues or the coworkers. When you talk about the air quality concerns or the heat problems?
P24: I would say, I mean the most negative. I would say, just people being indifferent to it, or, you know the like the bills that they can wrap up, especially like for the heat, the summertime positivewise. I would say,
P24: Like I mentioned. I haven't really
P24: had a certain discussion of air quality. But when we talk about whether heat, the most positive, I would say.
P24: would be would just the camaraderie of of talking shared similar experiences.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Okay, after that, does that reaction influence your thoughts or feelings or your behavior
Sung Hyoun Hong: anyways?
P24: I would say, yes. Sometimes we have conversations like.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Out, some.
P24: Mentioned like, Oh, my bill went up this month because of heat. Then it would kind of start
P24: conversation or thoughts, like, I would say, okay, like, you know, let's be conservative here, or, you know, have we thought about this? So it definitely sparks that you know that thought in your mind, and,
P24: I would maybe change yes, behavior, not significantly or just depending on the situation. But yes, definitely it would. It has caused me to think more for those conversations.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Got you, I see.
Sung Hyoun Hong: And my last question is in terms of their reactions. Did you notice any gender differences like like between
Sung Hyoun Hong: boys and girls?
P24: I would say I would say we
P24: just intuitively. I think men are more concerned about, you know.
P24: I I mean I am, too, of course. But I'm just saying, in my personal experience men are more concerned about like, oh, the the bills high this month, which I am, too. But you know, I'm more like, if I'm hot, I'm gonna turn the A/C on so intuitively. I think that
P24: that's something that I see. And then for females. It's I do see. Like all the females here, have their air purifiers.
