## Transcript
S: Hello, name.
P42: Hello!
S: How are you? Yes, I can hear you. It's very clear.
P42: Okay.
S: Thanks for your time to meeting with us.
P42: You're welcome, you're welcome.
S: I'm sunshine pack at management and marketing department.
S: and this research has been funded by our university around $10,000. And with this grant we are. We are conducting a interview.
S: And this is the 1st phase of the research. And you're the last interviewees for our research. So
S: okay. Sorry.
S: No. So we have plenty of time to prepare for the next phase. So we will start our survey. It's a daily survey for 2 weeks, so. But I believe that your you know, perspective will be really valuable for us to set up, you know, establish the research model.
S: So this is, I'm focusing about how we can, you know, increase awareness about the air
S: quality issue. And I realized that there are some people who's really sensitive to air quality, not everyone but some, but I feel like they are
S: quite minority. So when we say minority, we could, you know, simply think you know Hispanic or black
S: or Asian, but or female. But I feel like, you know, we can also call, you know, people who feel sensitive to the error code issue
S: as a minority, because they are less likely to, you know, voice out their opinion to the organization, even though they have opinion.
S: So with the Grant, I have invited my colleagues from Georgia State University, and here's sung in Ho, his Phd. Students at Georgia State University.
S: and we have another professors from Lola Marymount, and I think he, he!
S: He might join soon.
P42: But I just wanted to let you know.
S: And before we start our interview, is it okay to, you know, record the whole session of this interview for the for reviewing the transcription.
S: Thank you very much. We will not distribute any of your video or voice. We will only
S: leave, save the transcription, the text version of our interview, and we will replace all of your information
S: that we had collected from the interview to Capital A or B, so that no one can detect you and me
S: alright. So let's start. Can you tell us about your current role in your job?
P42: I am the gift processor. I'm in University advancement. So I work under the foundation.
P42: So I process all of the foundation gifts, whether it's scholarships, endowments.
P42: that run through the foundation.
P42: So.
S: Hmm, okay.
P42: I do deductions. I do a little bit more, but that is the role of my position.
S: Okay. I have been donated very small amount of money.
S: but maybe you might, you know, use that money, for you know, providing the gift for our donors.
P42: Yeah, we see it come through, for you know Bpa and Sme, just all over athletics.
S: Okay. How's the flexibility of your work? Does it require you to be in your office.
S: Okay.
P42: Yeah, I don't. I'm the only one in our department that is not able to work from home.
S: Hmm, okay.
P42: I am fully in the office every day.
S: do you also happen to work outside of your workplace? Your office.
P42: I go to the cashier multiple times a day.
P42: To take my stuff. So I am outside.
P42: But and I do 9, 8 80 s. So Monday, through Thursday I work 9 HA day
P42: besides summer, and then every other Friday I have off.
S: Okay, can you walk us through a typical day, including your working hours and after work hours.
P42: So I usually come in for the summer. I come in about 6 o'clock in the morning.
P42: So I do process like I run all my reports, run everything that I need to before the mail actually gets here.
P42: And then, once that's once I pull all the reports, and I know the cashier is open, but
P42: because they don't open till 8,
P42: I go down there, and I take what I have so far.
P42: Come back
P42: and do some other stuff until the mail comes. The mail doesn't usually come until before lunchtime, so between sometimes between 10 and 12, sometimes a little bit later, but then I go down there again.
P42: So I am out of the office.
P42: you know, in and out sometimes, just to move cause
P42: being here. We don't have windows in our office that I sit in. So it's kind of like.
P42: okay, I sent a box like, I need to go see some sunlight, but.
S: Yeah, that's pretty.
P42: Much by then, when I get off, I usually either run errands. Go back home. So yeah.
S: Okay? It seems like you are required to move outside because you need to pick up some. You know packages.
S: When there's when you order any day you feel like you don't want to go outside because of the dust
S: or poor air quality.
P42: That. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's I'm not from here.
P42: So this is definitely I can tell a huge difference. I lived in the desert.
P42: and everybody's like, Oh, well, isn't it the same? And I'm like, No, like we, we would get like an afternoon breeze, and it basically
P42: cleaned out everything plus our elevation was higher.
S: Hmm.
P42: Here we sit in a bowl, everything just kind of like sits.
S: Hmm.
P42: So
P42: when it is dusty, or just kinda like you can just tell the air is gross, or if there's a fire.
P42: it's kind of like, okay, I would rather make it one. Just run to the cashier. So I'll hold stuff until the checks get here. So it's just kind of
P42: I mean, some days it's nice out, and it's like, Oh, I'm gonna go for a walk, and I'll go to the cashier and do what I need to do or I
P42: just hold it.
S: So someday walk outside.
P42: We'll just go there once some days a couple of times. So yeah.
S: So someday, walking outside, could, you know, refresh your mind and your body. But someday, when the air quality is not good, actually it, you know it's a distrusting, you know. Moment.
P42: Yeah.
S: Okay, got it. I'm also, as you can tell from my appearance or my intonation. I'm from South Korea.
S: And actually, I lived in United States for since 2014, and lived in Illinois and Pittsburgh, where air was really good compared to where we live.
S: How long have you lived in southern Hawking Valley?
P42: We moved here. January of 2,022.
S: So I moved also in 2022 August.
S: It was a really hot year, right.
P42: Yes, and the bugs. I'm not used to bugs either. So
P42: yeah, and the mosquitoes like me. So.
P42: Yeah, I'm not a fan. My husband did the commute here for 10 years, and he was getting a promotion. And so that's why we moved. If it wasn't for that I wouldn't have moved.
S: So you're so.
P42: Not like. It's. It's interesting. My son is in high school, and there's when the air quality is so bad they have to cancel
P42: athletic practice.
S: Hmm.
P42: Because if the Aqi is too high.
P42: District does not allow them to practice.
S: Okay.
P42: Got used to that. I was like, Huh!
S: So you lived in until a valley before? Yeah, I have several students in Antelo Valley, and I have been teaching Antelope Valley for certain days for my AV. Campus.
S: and I could tell the difference in the air quality and also the wind speed. It's really windy over there.
P42: Yes.
P42: It is, and it's interesting when it's windy. Here everybody talks about valley fever.
S: There!
P42: It's windy, but it's not as prevalent as it is out here.
S: Hmm, yeah.
S: Belly fever. Okay, we will have a chance to talk in the later. You know. Question about the valley fever, because it's very scary
S: things when I 1st hear about belly fever, because actually, we don't know the cause of the belly fever, and it's not easy to prevent.
P42: Right. It's just the spores in the ground, in the dirt.
S: So how do you feel about the air quality in Bakersfield? I know you have some negative, you know experience about that. But can you elaborate more about it?
P42: Health wise. It's been
P42: definitely different. I have health issues that I didn't have before.
P42: My skin is definitely a lot more sensitive.
P42: I've never had, like eczema flare ups. And then now I've found out that
P42: when they thought it was eczema flare up it, actually, I am in the process of finding 2 different specialists because they have determined.
P42: I have 3 different autoimmune diseases.
S: So you find out you have that things once you have that symptom.
P42: What within the last month I found out, I've yeah.
P42: I have one that affects the skin, one that affects.
P42: There's just one is very rare
P42: and 2 well, I guess both of them are kind of rare, but I have to see 2 different specialists just for
P42: those 2 that are rare.
S: Okay. I also tried to meet with a specialist for my 6 month old daughter, when I 1st moved to Bakersfield in 2022. But was it easy to find a meet a specialist.
P42: Well, what ended up happening is it's showing up in my blood work.
P42: So they actually sent me over. I don't know if you know, Cbcc, comprehensive cancer and Blood Center.
S: Hmm.
P42: So they started actually testing me to see if I had a blood disorder
P42: or potentially cancer because of my blood work.
S: Hmm.
P42: And come to find out. It was due to having autoimmune.
S: Hmm.
P42: Diseases. So, and it's gotten worse. Since I've lived here.
S: Okay.
S: So
P42: Specialist. For the one that affects my liver, that it attacks. Basically the healthy part of it.
P42: I technically need to see somebody at Ucla.
S: With our insurance.
P42: We might not have.
S: Yeah, I heard that.
P42: Yeah, which is unfortunate, because there's 2 doctors that actually study what I have
P42: and do research. Nobody out here does.
S: Yeah, I think currently we are negotiating. Our insurance is negotiating with the Ucla. So I hope we could.
S: And the contract.
P42: I do, too.
S: Oh, my! Gosh!
P42: Yeah,
P42: So it's interesting, health-wise. If it wasn't for my husband's job and his pension, because he works for the State.
P42: I I wouldn't live here.
S: Your husband is also working at Cal State.
P42: No, he works for the Department of Water resources. He a water project.
S: Okay.
P42: So he's done that for 14 years.
P42: and when he 1st got the job in Bakersfield well, he's actually near the grapevine kind of where the.
S: I'm with.
P42: Far.
P42: he was having chronic sinus infections. And the interesting thing is the doctor's like what has changed. And this was in Lancaster. He goes. You've never had these issues. What is going on? And he's like, Well, I do work in Bakersfield, and he's like, Do you have to.
P42: Basically like.
P42: that's what prompted. So yeah, unfortunately, if it wasn't for our retirement and the time that my husband has with the State.
P42: I I personally would move.
S: Yeah, we all know that our State, you know, workers have very generous pension, especially for the not me. But you know, for the senior people.
P42: Yeah.
S: Okay? Right? It's it's not easy to decide, because pension is really good.
S: Okay.
P42: Been there now enough time that like, and he's moved up the ladder that very hard to leave.
S: Hmm, hmm.
S: okay, I think that's a good, great responsibility, because I believe that managing water in California. It's 1 of the
S: critical things, I believe.
S: Yeah. So it seems like your perspective on air quality has been developed since you moved to Bakersfield. So
S: how.
P42: Wasn't what I thought about like you never thought about it before.
P42: Now you do.
S: So regarding the information about the air quality. How did you collect those things? It seems like you didn't know. I think you already knew about the bad air quality in Bakersfield. But
S: you realize that how it feel like after you moved to Bakersfield. So how does that perspective on the air quality, develop across 3 years.
P42: I think the the main
P42: has been my skin. The difference in issues with my skin that
P42: even without, like the autoimmune, which is interesting because they've said it's environmental like triggers that
P42: that and stress that like bring them on.
P42: I just feel like my skin
P42: has just completely been different since I've moved here.
P42: Where? It's more of like a flare up. And I've had to see the dermatologist multiple times. And
P42: so just stuff like that. That's it's interesting.
P42: Even cleaning air filters in your house.
S: Hmm.
P42: It's like a every other month thing because they don't last as long
P42: as they do elsewhere. We didn't have to change like we could go 3 months.
P42: or you know, every season here it's like
P42: we have to check it every month to every other month.
S: I. I also recognize that when I checked the filter from Hvac.
S: It collects lots of dust within a month.
P42: Yeah.
S: Yeah, it's totally different from what I what I've experienced in Pittsburgh.
S: Okay? So and also other than your skin, you said from your son's, you know.
S: experience from the cancellation of the game or training, and your.
P42: Practice. Yeah, for the district. Yeah, it has to. The Aqi has to be at a lower than a certain point.
P42: or they have to cancel it. They can't be, or they have to extend
P42: the the practice out further out in the day where the error might not be as bad right after school. They might like postpone it for like 2, 3 h, see if it gets any better. If not, then they cancel it.
S: Okay,
S: we briefly talk about how bad air quality influence your working you know activity, how about your daily activities, how in what ways do air, quality affect your daily activities?
P42: I feel like I used to enjoy being outside the house, whether it was like planting flowers or doing that, or just hanging out. I mean, I was very adamant about wanting a pool here, and it's very interesting. I would rather not be outside, and now I feel bad that I was adamant about getting a pool when I'm like, I really would rather not be outside
P42: so. But it's it's interesting. I mean, I still get like.
P42: because I need the vitamin d, but like I still go out. But it's just not what I used to.
S: okay, has air quality, affect your work, productivity.
P42: No I mean no, I mean, we all wonder in here how well.
P42: Ventilated. I mean, it's not the outside air, but how well our buildings are.
P42: And what we're breathing in.
P42: But I luckily I mean I I go to the cashier, and where our building is at.
P42: I am lucky in that aspect. I'm not. I mean there is times I do have to walk across campus to go pick up checks.
P42: From other areas. But
P42: I mean, I try not to let it affect my job. I think more or less. I feel like, we all kind of wonder what we breathe inside the building.
P42: Okay.
S: In order to deal with the bad air quality issues. Have you ever, you know, add air purifier in your office or wearing mask while you walk outside.
P42: I've covered like when we've had, like the dust storms. I have covered my mouth like my mouth with like a jacket.
P42: And did that
P42: outside, and like we kind of hurried, because I do have to bring somebody with me.
P42: But
P42: no, I know my coworker in the next office. They did have an air purifier. I don't know if they still have it on
P42: but I've thought about it.
P42: but we don't have very many plugs in our office.
S: Have you ever considered asking your managers to have air purifier in your office?
P42: No, with the budget, no.
S: That is definitely not a.
P42: Not a not a thing.
S: Okay, huh?
S: Have you noticed that the air quality also impacted others around you?
P42: What's say? Like allergy wise, you can definitely tell
P42: in the office with the allergies.
S: Hmm.
P42: Certain times a year I'll get like the sinus
P42: kind of like headache where it's just
P42: I think more really just the allergies when you're not used. I'm not used to any of the trees out here.
P42: I mean, I'm just from the desert. It's completely different. So what grows here does not grow in the evening.
S: Like almond pistachio.
P42: Almonds, even just like the regular like trees that you see in the house at the house, you know, in the front yards.
P42: Here. It's weed in. It's completely different. Type of trees.
S: Okay.
P42: As feels different.
S: Yeah, it's totally different. Right? Yeah, I can see that even though we are living in the same country, I feel like we are. You know, isolated in the different part of the world.
S: So how do so when you look at your husband, you know you moved to Bakersfield because of your husband's work. And how does?
S: How does your husbands might feel about your symptoms from the air quality issue.
P42: He's I mean.
P42: he's very much like I mean, we have to be here, unfortunately, until he, because his office is here.
P42: we could transfer with that out of the State. But he's the only trainer in the State of California for his position.
P42: or who he trains.
S: Hmm.
P42: It's really hard he'd have to completely change positions. But he's a very good about
P42: if I need to see doctors in La or somewhere else. He's very much like, let's go. Let whoever you need to see
P42: But it's hard. It's kind of like
P42: we have to suck it up, which is unfortunate.
S: Yeah, I, I feel a very similar emotion because, I moved. We moved here to Bakersfield because of my job. And once we moved to Bakersfield. Our 6 month old. Our 3rd baby have had respiratory, you know, symptoms, and also my wife had you know thyroid issue. You don't know that air quality issue had caused that. But
S: my wife believes that definitely. Bakersfield caused her to be sick.
P42: Yeah.
S: So.
P42: It's really it's. It's unfortunate that
P42: there isn't more studies on what they can do with our air. It's.
P42: But.
S: Okay, now, let's dive more deep into what we want to research. So
S: you know, you are outsider from the eyes of the people, from Bakerfield, and
S: have you ever shared? You know the air quality concerns with the people.
S: with with your colleagues who are born and raised in Bakersfield.
P42: Yeah, I mean, as far as because I don't think
P42: from what it sounds like, I feel like a lot.
P42: Coworkers that are from here.
P42: Don't realize that it's I mean, if you go an hour away, that it's not the same.
S: Hmm, hmm.
P42: Either north or south.
P42: It's just not this, it's just different.
P42: And so it's really hard to explain. Like, I'm not used to this. This is like here. It's not where I'm from. We don't have that bad air. There.
S: Hmm.
P42: I mean, and it's but
P42: I think it's everybody knows that it's there.
P42: And I do think it's interesting.
P42: Either the allergies or the health concerns that people now have.
P42: Is it truly because of the air
P42: for me I'm like, is it because I'm getting older?
P42: But it's interesting. The symptoms that I within the last year have just really
P42: affected. I mean, if it wasn't for the fact, I switched doctors
P42: they would have never run the test that they ran, and like referred me to Cbcc.
S: Hmm.
P42: And then. Now they're referring me to all these places. So it's interesting, like, certain doctors are really
P42: look at you. And like, okay, this is not a normal.
P42: but yeah, I just think it's unfortunate, because there's quite a few people.
P42: I mean, even in this building, that it's affected.
S: Okay.
P42: But I think it's also like
P42: I feel like it's skin. It's we're breathing it in
P42: what's gonna come of it in 20 years.
P42: you know. That's the scary part.
S: yeah.
S: about this? You know your, your health symptoms, from the air quality issue, like skin or, your blood. You know, test outcomes. Have you ever shared those things with
S: your colleagues in your workplace?
P42: When I started having issues. And there's only a few that know, like what I'm dealing with.
P42: And there is. It's interesting. There's 1 that's she's from here, and it's kind of like
P42: the correlation of just like what comes up after living here.
S: Hmm.
P42: But
P42: yeah, it's I mean, there's a few of us. Actually, there's 2 out of the 3 in my office.
P42: We are not from here.
S: Hmm.
P42: And then in our hallway. There's quite a few, but it's hard to tell.
P42: Oh, is the air really be cut late?
P42: I know the skin issue. I really do think it is the air.
S: Hmm.
P42: The other 2. They're so rare it's hard to tell what triggered it.
S: But the chances of having.
P42: 3 autoimmune diseases in the fact in the time that I've been here is kind of insane.
S: Hmm, okay, so when I understand your
S: sharing of your experiences, you don't have enough chance to share about your symptom with other colleagues.
P42: No, I kind of not too many people know. Unfortunately. There are some that do know.
P42: I didn't want.
P42: I think, when it comes to your health. There's it's kind of like I told my boss when I had to, because of all the appointments that are.
S: Right
P42: And scans that I have to have done. It's just it was kind of like, unless they're really
P42: and the need to know.
P42: One found out just out of pure coincidence. But this has just come up within the last month. It's so new.
S: Hmm.
P42: So. No, I don't really tell too many.
S: Okay. So for your manager, your boss, you are not reluctant to, you know.
S: share your symptoms, but you had to, because you need to adjust your schedule.
P42: Yeah.
S: Okay.
P42: Because if some doctors don't do Friday appointments, I was lucky with 2 of the doctors did
P42: when I needed to do the scan.
P42: The MRI scan.
P42: That was during work hours.
S: Hmm, okay.
S: How about the other colleagues do they share?
S: do your colleagues? And you had ever talked about air collar issue together.
S: Just so
P42: Just, and because one does live here one
P42: kind of near here, but not in Bakersfield. She's not from in Bakersfield just because just the issue, especially like with allergies, and when
P42: it's interesting as well how you feel at work compared to sometimes at home.
S: Hmm.
P42: And it there's like you need that day just to kind of like, relax when you get here. I just feel like a lot of people are always sick here. I don't know what it is.
P42: and it's like. Sometimes I want to be in a bubble and close the door because it's like, Oh, my gosh! Why is everybody coughing? Why is everybody sneezing?
P42: I just feel like the immune system.
S: Hmm.
P42: Is not very strong.
S: Hmm, okay.
P42: But yeah, I mean we do talk about it.
P42: I think you you spoke with Devin. He's not from here, and his allergies are horrible.
S: Looks really healthy, though.
P42: Yeah, he's he's just got horrible, I mean, when you see him, and he has like the watery eyes, and just like the horrible allergies. He's from the Bay Area
P42: so totally different. Air, cleaner air.
P42: Yeah, it's I mean, it's something we all talk about. But it's kind of like we all feel stuck.
S: And you feel you don't have much hope to improve it.
P42: I guess it's always been this way.
P42: I don't know why. I wish I wish they could figure out
P42: how to change. I mean. I know it's how it's built, and it's like we sit in a bowl. But yeah, it's interesting.
S: Yeah.
P42: I think a lot of it is. Yeah, being more aware of, like, how much people are sick.
S: Hmm, okay.
S: Can you describe general attitude toward
S: When you discuss about discuss with your colleagues? Can you describe the general attitude toward, you know.
S: environmental health topics at work.
S: Do you feel, you know, comfortable? Do you think that your colleagues comfortable, talking about that.
P42: Sometimes we do. We do talk about it. Sometimes we're just all on different schedules, and sometimes we're just so busy. Some of us will like chit, chat and stuff
P42: and talk about things. But it's just
P42: sometimes it's so hard because we're either so like one of us or a couple of us is so busy that normally talk we're kind of spread out in the building. And so not all of us
P42: really get together, and either talk about like
P42: personal personal stuff a lot of times. It's just work related.
S: Okay.
P42: But there is a few of us that yeah, like, we feel comfortable talking to each other about it.
S: Okay, have you ever wanted to wear a mask, but felt hesitant to
S: wear it due to social pressure?
P42: I mean, of course, like during covid and stuff I always I mean I did except for when I worked from home.
S: Hmm.
P42: I think I'm it's hard. I we have like
P42: some in here, but I don't even know how old they are.
P42: I mean, I have no problem
P42: covering my face when I'm have to go outside, and it's like dusty and.
S: Right.
P42: Really windy, and you can just tell the air is kind of like that light, brown, easy look, but.
S: Okay as a new employee in our organization and also
S: new employees outside of the Bakersfield when you talk about the air quality issue in Bakersfield. Have you ever felt like, you know, you're offending people in
S: people who has born and raised in Bakersfield.
P42: I think it's it's pretty known. I don't think it's
P42: and if we talk about it, it's nothing like mean or directed. It's I think it's more facts.
S: Hmm.
P42: When we, especially when we talk about the Aqi and just like
P42: But I also don't know if it's just gotten worse, and maybe it hasn't always been this way. I mean, I guess the same thing with Ab. It wasn't always that windy.
S: Hmm, and it depends.
P42: Depends on what side of town you're on. So it's interesting. I've never
P42: at least when I talk about it, or like it gets brought up. It's not mean.
S: Hmm.
P42: It's just how your way of life is just different.
P42: It has like affected some of us.
S: And you think that you believe that the response from the Arab code is very different from the people who are born and raised in Bakersfield, and people.
P42: I think, like they they know and it
P42: I don't. I just think it's known. But like I'm never like nobody's ever been offended.
S: okay,
S: all right. So sometimes people feel some sense of connection, when they face common challenges, like, we experienced bad air quality in Bakersfield.
S: and when you learn that others share similar environmental concerns like air, quality issue or heat.
S: how does that influence your feeling.
P42: Can you repeat it? Sorry!
S: When you found out that the other colleagues also experienced the same. You know, health issue
S: like respiratory disease or some health symptoms from air quality issue. How do you feel?
P42: It kind of makes me nervous.
P42: I'm gonna lie. Cause it's kind of like, okay, like I think in a way, you, I kind of think like, Okay, well, that's my fear is like what else? Long term.
S: Huh!
P42: Is gonna come of it.
S: Hmm!
S: Because, you know, as my grandmother died of lung cancer.
S: Hmm.
P42: Smoked in 50 years, and so
P42: kind of like one of those things that it's like
P42: you just don't know environmental. Or you hear about people with lung cancer that never smoked a day in their life.
P42: So you just don't know environmental like how the air
P42: how everything is going to affect you later on. So when other people have issues as well, it's that nervousness that's like, okay.
P42: if you have stuff going on. And I have stuff going on. And you do, too.
P42: What's going to come of this later?
S: Hmm.
P42: And then, like, you know, your your daughter. That's 6 months like that's just it's scary.
S: Hmm hmm so
P42: Sphere.
S: So when you share.
S: when each other shares about air, quality concerns and symptoms, you realize that that issue
S: became an object of truth, and it became, you know you feel more fear about it. Right.
P42: Yeah.
S: Okay.
S: But when you talk about those kind of matters, don't you share how you could deal with that. Things like
S: share strategy, to overcome or deal with the error quality issue. You cannot.
P42: Like, I know. Some do have like the air purifiers at home, and so that's an option.
P42: The hard part is, you don't want to live in your home
P42: like you want to be able to go out.
S: Hmm.
P42: So it's taking advantage of those nice days like after the rain.
P42: When the air is a little bit better, or when the wind.
P42: It's kind of blown everything out, and you can tell the air, and you can see the mountains. And like, when you can see the mountains, you're like, okay, it's not so bad today, like, today's a good day to go out.
S: When I see the mountains I feel like
S: how was it like when native Americans like they lived here in 500 years ago, without any cars it would be really awesome, seeing all the view of the mountains surrounding Bakersfield, and also Kern River.
P42: Yeah.
S: Hmm!
S: Have you ever felt isolated, due to health? You know air quality related concerns.
P42: No.
S: Hmm, okay.
S: So the reason why I ask that is, you know, if you're the only one who have the symptom and not the others. Maybe you could feel isolated.
P42: I mean, I lately I've
P42: mean it's an emotional thing to like.
P42: Go through everything and have multiple doctor's appointments.
P42: I mean, I had 3 last week alone. So I think.
P42: what's hard and what's I mean? And I don't even know if it's isolating. It's just kind of like.
P42: how much can one person take
P42: and not know the why like do it? Is it truly the air? I feel like the skin part? Yes.
P42: the other stuff.
P42: It's so much unknown until I can actually see these specialists.
S: Hmm.
P42: To see if they're like do you really need to live there kind of like what they did with my husband? You really need to work there.
P42: I would be curious when I'm able to actually see like there's 1 specialist I can't even see till October.
S: Hmm.
P42: So it's really hard to try and get answers when some of these appointments are so far out.
S: So
S: tentatively, you might think that air quality could affect your many of the symptom. But you're not sure about that because you haven't met your doctor yet.
S: 10.
P42: Like. They gave me the paperwork as far as like. So one of them does say, or there's a couple that say environmental
P42: like stressors.
S: Hmm.
P42: Like
P42: for me. I'm like, Well, I am new here, and this is all starting to come up. So it's
P42: that part is interesting.
P42: So I would be curious in the coming months, like exactly what they have to say, especially since
P42: I'm going to start seeing them here first, st and then, if I'm not happy, then go south.
S: Okay?
S: Yeah. I think your experience little bit similar
S: experience. When I when I felt in 2022 because of my 6 month, baby. We wanted to meet a doctor, but since we were a new employee our insurance has started
S: and October, so we had to wait for 3 months, but
S: but I had to meet the doctor just meeting the doctor. It cost me like $385,
S: and going to the La without me. My wife got
S: going to La with a taxi. It will. It costs $400.
P42: Oh, my goodness!
S: So it cost more than $1,000 to just watch a doctor.
P42: Yeah, it's it's it's interesting. I
P42: started to do like just a research on like, we just don't even have a lot of
P42: medical doctors here. I mean to just to choose from. It's very, very, very few.
S: Hmm, yeah, I heard that doctors
S: are mostly came from other region, and once they qualify certain, you know, career, you know, goal. They move to other place like San Jose or La, the bigger place.
S: So we are having newer, newer doctor. But the accumulation of the knowledge is not could.
P42: Or they're near retirement, and they're.
S: Deanna.
P42: Ready to be done.
S: Yeah, right?
S: Okay, one similar question. So have you ever felt like you're the only one worried about the air quality while your colleagues seemed unbothered.
P42: No, no, because I feel like there's so many, I think, even in this building that are not from here.
P42: That I think you don't feel alone in that aspect.
S: Okay. What would feel? What would it feel like to have colleagues who truly understand your environmental health concerns like Devin.
P42: Yeah, I mean, it's very interesting. I feel like we're very diverse here. We have quite a few that are out of state
P42: completely out of Bakersfield. So
P42: it's very you don't feel alone at all, and.
P42: Like
P42: Devin's wife is in my office, so.
S: Hmm.
P42: Out about my health concerns through his wife. But yeah, it's
P42: it's just one of those things that I think in that aspect you definitely don't feel alone.
S: Finally.
P42: Don't talk about it very often, you know. You don't feel alone.
S: And.
P42: It's almost like it's a calm. It's like everybody knows. Everybody knows our air is bad.
S: So do you feel like sense of like, you know? Bond or camarado.
P42: Yeah, in a sense.
S: Okay, can you elaborate more about it? Because I think.
P42: In that camera like it's just it's like, I guess, a comfort, knowing that
P42: because there might be in other areas that maybe just like one or 2 are not from Bakersfield.
S: Hmm.
P42: Here there's quite a few, and where everybody else is from
P42: they didn't have bad air before.
S: Hmm.
P42: So. But I mean, it's not like that's all we talk about. That's
P42: a lot of us are just sometimes so busy.
P42: But you definitely don't feel alone in that aspect.
S: Even you don't talk. You just know that they feel the same.
P42: Yeah.
P42: Okay.
P42: we do go to meetings with each other. And it's just like, sometimes something might come up. But yeah.
P42: it's just.
P42: And then, yeah, it's, I mean.
P42: we have a good relationship. We know when we're really busy, we're just we're busy. And then when there's times we can chit chat. We can chit, chat, and like talk about. You know how we're doing, or you know.
S: Oh!
P42: Stuff like that. But.
S: So it seems like, you can be yourself in your organization if you want to talk, just talk. And if you want to, just.
P42: Like, we know, like I mean, there's some things you just don't want to talk about, I mean, not everybody knows. I would say, maybe
P42: there's only like a couple of people that know what I'm going through right now.
P42: So I think it's just something that I just keep to myself.
S: Especially.
P42: Since it's like it's still so new.
S: Okay. And I hope.
P42: My kids like my kids don't know.
S: Okay, all of this interview will be kept in secret.
P42: So yeah, because.
S: It's included in the research ethics.
S: Okay? One last question. So what kinds of support or initiative do you think that our organization can provide to better address air quality concerns.
P42: I do think it would be nice if we have the option of air purifiers like, without having to
P42: purchase them ourselves.
P42: That would be.
P42: And then just checking Link. We've never had our air filters in here even looked at. I've been here 3 years.
P42: and I'm like there's not been one person that's ever looked at our air filter like that's gotta be weird, I mean, Heaven only knows what's growing up in there.
P42: But I think in lease, at least in that aspect.
P42: I mean, there's some people that might just stay in their building all day, and don't leave, you know. Come in when they come in in the morning and leave when they go home.
P42: I can minimize my risk by just going once down there.
P42: and I don't go far, but
P42: I think that option. If we really wanted an air purifier in here, at least we know we would have
P42: better air in here, cause at some point we're like, we don't know what we're breathing in here.
S: Do you feel like? Our organization is carrying the health of our employees.
P42: I don't think that they don't care. I just think that the position that we're in there's only so much they can do.
S: Hmm, okay, alright. So we had consumed all of your time and thanks for your valuable contribution.
S: and I will send you a Amazon gift card right after this interview. Thank you, name.
P42: You're very welcome. Thank you.
S: Thank you. Have a good one. Bye.
P42: You, too. Bye-bye.
