C: so what's your thought on air quality. So how do you feel about the air quality in Sinokin Valley?
P4: The art quality. There is the major concern.
P4: The valleys are beautiful, but I would say the persistence doors, the smoke. It can make it quite difficult to enjoy outdoor activities like, if you want to hang out with your family outside and things like that, the air quality can make it really difficult to do that, because you will always have concern about. Oh, the air, the breathing, my children!
P4: They're okay. Things like that.
C: Hmm! So like. So does the air quality really affect your daily life at work and home?
P4: I'll I would say.
P4: The air quality affects us, especially we in the teaching side and the children that are in school because of the art quality. We have to take precautionary motive like wearing of masks when situations like that are very bad, especially during the summer, we have to
P4: wear masks and make sure that the children are safe. And during those time we make sure we also limit outdoor activities and make sure the activities they do are mostly indoors.
C: Okay.
C: so is it only during the summertime? Or is it both that even the wintertime too? So is it. The the effect is the same in the summer and the winter, or is just summertime.
P4: I would say, during the summer and fall time.
C: It's cool.
P4: Intense, but during the winter it can be a bit mild, not as intense as during the summertime.
C: so have you seen the same impact on your friends, roommates or coworkers or people around you having the problem to deal with the air quality.
P4: You know I told you that my spouse is
P4: working in healthcare, and when he comes home, and he expresses concern about patients experiencing worse symptoms, like patients who struggle with asthmas.
P4: During that time it can be a bit difficult for them to be able to leave. They have to take more precautionary motive, and things like that, and even coworkers that have a bit of low, immune system where the immune system are not quite strong. They also get to call in sick. Sometimes during those periods.
C: Okay, okay, I understand. Yeah, that's concerning actually.
C: But does, it has an impact on your family members. Health.
P4: Yeah, it has impact on my family. Because, my younger child, 3 years old. She's having asthma, and it can be a bit consigning in having to provide for her and make sure the quality of the air does not affect her much.
C: Okay, okay, so do you ex, do you think experiencing air pollution with others? Does does it strengthen your sense of connection in your organization like
C: like, how do I say like so when you have with your when you get together with your friends and family, does it? Do you have? I mean, is this a topic of talk or like, does it have any connections in your organization regarding the air quality
C: like, do you guys.
P4: Yeah, yeah, I would say, it's
P4: It's give us a topic to talk about and complain because me and my colleagues or my family we often talk about. We give each other's ideas on the way to
P4: help each other like using a purifiers, making sure we are on Max. So the amount of air we, the amount of bad airway taking, can be reduced a lot, and since, like a year, we make sure we talk. They give us a topic to talk on, sometimes to just complain, sometimes to share ideas on our going right through each day.
C: Yeah, even, I use the air air purifier. And once I take it to clean, it's it's really bad. I understand.
P4: Yeah.
C: Okay, so so how do you?
C: So when you talk about air quality problems, does, it has any positive impact or like.
C: So when you share with the
C: so what are the main common challenges that you face when you share the problem? So some people say, Oh, it's okay. I'm okay with air quality. Or some people say yes, or some people might say no. So I mean, when you do, you feel a
C: so like
C: some. Sometimes we get along with the people who say, No, right? So do you feel any
C: challenges like dealing with air quality.
P4: Yeah, I feel some challenges dealing with air quality. And when I discuss that with some people, not everybody might agree to my opinion or things like that. But the people that do agree, we share our opinion on how to do things, and because I'm also having a child with asthma. I make sure I try to get new knowledge every day on how to make sure that the air does not really affect them.
C: Okay? So
C: so when so when the response was received like, does, it made any impact on your connections with them? Or was it all right with them like they were positive about it?
P4: It's made an impact and a connection with them. Because, I feel, since we have the same topic, we have the same opinion on things. We can be friends.
C: Okay, okay? So the question is like, so you told me that you use air purifier, etcetera. So is this the way even your colleagues deal with the bad air quality around us, or like, or do they them? And do they use something else to prevent it?
P4: Some of my colleagues. They use Max, and some they use monitoring Aqi levels.
C: Okay, okay.
C: so does your organization or your company helps you? Helps the employees overcome air quality issues. Are they taking anything.
P4: They provide Max. And they yeah, to provide Max.
C: Okay, so what do you think about your organization's action? Is it sufficient like, what's your in? What's your take on your
C: the company's actions on the particular issue.
P4: I feel that their actions is encouraging us to take care of our health more, and for us to stay safe.
C: So, so has the support from your organization.
C: Change the prospective on air quality issues.
P4: This support from the organization has not really changed the the air quality issues. I just feel like it's just a temporary solution.
C: so does it feel does the initiation initiation from them helps you strengthen the connection to the organization or no, it does not.
P4: The initiative of me. Strengthen my connections them because I feel that they care about this stuff and the people working under them.
C: Okay?
C: So do you see yourself continuing and work in this area for long term?
P4: Yeah, I feel myself working there because they care about their staffs and also my passion for teaching.
C: Okay, so imagine the air quality has significantly improved. So how do you think? It would affect your life or your connection to the community?
P4: If the air quality reduced, I'll get more time to spend with my family on outdoor activities. We'll have a range of outdoor activities to do with my family, and I'll feel more connected to the community. And I would also have less worries. I will stop worrying about my child health and also my health. Yeah, I'll stop worrying about the risk of the air intake.
C: So what factors do you think? Which makes the people leave San Johan Valley.
C: Quality, or like.
P4: I feel
P4: definitely, the air quality will be part. But like, I said. In my competition in the school I work in. They make sure to provide math, and they also install a few cars in the
P4: staff rooms and stuff like that. So for me, I feel that probably the reason apart from the bad air quality is also because of the lack of support from the organization or the corporation where they are
P4: working. Yeah.
C: So. What factors do you think can make people stay in San Joaquin Valley?
P4: I feel that if they have encouragement and they are seeing signs of improvement in the quality, not just even if they're seeing encouragement in the
P4: quality of the air keeps getting bad. People still want to live, but I feel if they are seeing encouragement just incorporation, and the air quality is also getting a little bit better. People want it, because I would say the place is a good place to live.
C: True. True.
C: So I understand what already said. I really appreciate what you're saying. So is there anything that you would like to share about your experience with air quality or community connections in Sana.
