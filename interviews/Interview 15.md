# Interview 15

## Transcript
S: So this research we are conducting is about air quality in Bakersfield, and I'm conducting a research with my colleagues. Dr. Lee at Loyola Marymount University, you know, in Los Angeles, and Sung Hyoun Hong from Georgia State University.
 
[participant #15]: Okay, that sounds great.
 
S: So basically, what we'll do is listen to your valuable idea and your perspectives on how air quality impacts the life of employees in San Joaquin Valley.
 
[participant #15]: Okay.
 
S: Okay, so and after we finish the year view I will send you a $20 Amazon gift card for the appreciation for taking your time, and it would be great if you can share this opportunity with your colleagues or your family members, or your people around you about this opportunity.
It would be great if you can recommend this opportunity, for the people who thinks the error quality here is not good.
 
[participant #15]: Okay, yeah, of course.
 
S: Thank you very much.
 
S: So first, let's talk about your current role in your job.
 
S: Can you please tell us about your current role in your job, like, you know,
 
S: whether there are physical required, physical presence or flexibility in time you work or work and indoors or outdoors something like that.
 
[participant #15]: Sorry about that. So I currently work 2 office jobs. I work in the undergraduate admissions office on campus at Cal State, Bakersfield. Also work as an HR expert at [company X].
They're pretty flexible. But yeah, I primarily just work indoors. Sometimes I'll work outdoors like this. Saturday. We work the runner's Day event for [university X] and so that required us to be outdoors for most of it. I don't know if you want me to expand or.
 
S: Can you walk us through a typical day for you, including both work and non-work activities?
 
[participant #15]: Yeah. So for work, I'll typically arrive at the office at 8 am. I'll open up emails, respond to them. If they're in the wrong place, I'll forward them, or just anything like that, guide them in the right direction. And then from there, depending on how much influx of student transcripts we have. We'll go ahead and we'll look at them and and data enter their their courses and then from there, if we have some leftover indexing, we have to do for for transcripts, we'll go ahead and put that into the system and that usually takes up most of the time of work and then outside of work I'll go and I'll typically run 5 miles. So I like being outdoors for most of it. And I can tell you more about that. If that's something that you're interested in about like the air quality. But yeah.
 
S: Depend on the air quality in Bakersfield, you know, the air quality varies daily. Right? So do you typically pick some certain day to run? Or do you pick specific time or window? You run in a day.
 
[participant #15]: Well, typically it, it depends. If it's the summer. I know the the air quality gets worse, and it just feels it's like it just feels terrible, so I'll just go around like 5 am.
But say, if it's in the like right now, I'll go at 4 Pm. 5 pm, I'd say that's probably like the best time thankfully. The air quality hasn't been too terrible right now. It has been worse in in the past years. But I know it'll it'll come back again soon.
 
S: Okay, thank you.
 
S: So how long you? How long have you lived in San Joaquinbelly?
 
[participant #15]: My whole life. So 20 years.
 
S: So your parents brought you here before you were born.
 
[participant #15]: Yup pretty much.
 
S: That's wonderful. So you might have some experiences how air quality has been changed across multiple years.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, for sure. I know that my brother has asthma, and I've even experienced some some athletic asthma. But yeah, we we've seen it firsthand. How their quality has impacted us.
 
S: You mean athletic asthma.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I think it's mainly it just arises when you run a lot or like you do a lot of exercise. So that's when it gets provoked.
 
S: How do you feel about air quality in San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield.
 
[participant #15]: Well, it's it's a shame at times, because I know it can get really bad. So I would just describe it as that as it can be a shame. But I mean, primarily, I mean, there are places with worse air quality.
It's it's just a little unfortunate, you know, but it's for the most part manageable.
 
S: Okay, you expressed that. You feel shame you didn't committed contribute to the bad air quality. But can you elaborate more? Why do you feel shame?
 
[participant #15]: It's just a shame, because, you know, we we have to put up with this as like the residents. So it's just. you know, just the situation that you're kind of just put in. So it just really not to be vulgar or anything. But it just sucks in a way.
 
S: Okay. So you just shared us that you frequently change your running time based on the season, and depends on the season, the air quality.
The pattern of the air quality varies. But beside that, in what ways does the air quality affect your daily life at work and home?
 
[participant #15]: At times. If it's really bad, I'll probably just put on a mask. So I'd say, that's how it would affect me. I actually went down to LA when the fires were happening.
And you know it's kind of the sort of the same thing. Wear a mask, and just hope and pray that you're all right, and by the end of it.
 
S: So you describe how air quality affect your life and outdoor. But how about at your home?
 
[participant #15]: At my home. It's a little bit tricky. If I don't have to do anything, I would probably just try to stay home as much as possible. So that way, I'm not breathing in all that. All that bad air quality, as you say. But, yeah, I'll probably just try to stay home as much as possible if if it's 1 of those down days, and I don't have to work, and it's a bad air quality day.
 
S: Okay. I remember that I had to teach on the day it was a fall season when there's a heavy dust tornado.
 
[participant #15]: Still enough.
 
S: And I can. I could barely see. The places like, you know, a few feet away from me. So yes, I remember that it was a soci week, and all students need to come to the class to evaluate me as a lecture. But there were only 5 students in classroom. So in in those days. Do you also stay at your home?
 
[participant #15]: Honestly, I'm the type to not want to miss, so I would probably go, but I would try to stay as indoor as possible. Like. If I have the the class, I'll I'll try to see the quickest route to it.
and then I'll try to stay there not as long as others. I don't wanna be outside for too long, you know.
 
S: Okay. But there are some people who does not care about the, their air quality around them. They just don't. They feel that that does not affect them.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, yeah, I could see that. I was on the red brick road today, and they were giving a notice about valley fever, so I feel like I was like that to a certain point. But then I've seen somebody firsthand get valley fever. And it just does not look fun, so I'd rather just try to avoid it as much as possible.
 
S: So you said, red, red, brick.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah. The
 
[participant #15]: The road in the middle of the campus.
 
S: So they provide some medical information.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, they were here. Around like 12.
 
S: So our campus does provide some information about the risk of the valley fever and air quality issue for our students and employees.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I feel like it's just some students don't go out and interact with them. So that's where I guess the disconnect gets lost, or it gets heavy.
 
S: So regarding facing those air quality issues. What actions have you taken to deal with these challenges regarding air quality.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, probably just wearing masks. I know we have an air pure purifier, but I mean there's only so much it can do in our home. But yeah, just air purifier masks.
 
S: Pretty much just that I don't satisfy with the air purifier in our building.
So when the air comes from the ceiling. There was a time I kept coughing.
Does not have a proper filtering system.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, it's it's very likely. Yeah, I could see that.
 
S: Do you also experience those kind of issues in your building.
 
[participant #15]: Occasionally. Yeah. Yeah.
 
S: Regarding the air quality impacting us. Have you noticed the the impact of air quality on the others around you, including your family members.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, probably my brother. His asthma's pretty. It was pretty bad growing up, so it put him at risk for a lot, because he also had it had heart problems.
So he had to get a heart heart surgery. So it was kind of scary having to see all that, especially with his asthma, because it can affect them in that way as well.
 
S: Okay. I heard that many people had to move to Tejapi for the clean air, as of the younger ones, asthma or relative symptom.
Have had your parents also considered to do that. Maybe that's not the official option for all family, because it's too far away. But.
 
[participant #15]: No, they hadn't considered that. They had. They've lived in bud and willow before. In Wasco. But no, I I don't think they've ever considered it. Maybe they should have. But yeah.
 
S: Okay, how do you feel about when your brother had health issue because of the bad air quality in Bakersfield.
 
[participant #15]: I was pretty young at the time, so it was kind of shocking to see all that, but looking back at it now, it's kind of. It's just very unfortunate that he had to go through all that, especially since we had to live here, and we had no choice, and he just kind of gone thrown in there. But other than that, yeah, I would just probably say it's it's it was shocking.
 
S: Okay, does that impact you on the decision that you? You want to work at the company in Bakersfield? Or you want to work at a company outside of Bakersfield because of the air quality issue.
Does your experiences with your brother kind of influence, those preferences.
 
[participant #15]: I would say no, but I feel like subconsciously, maybe because I am open to working outside of of Bakersfield, and who knows? Maybe deep down. That is a factor that plays into it. but I'm not sure yet.
S: Have you shared have you ever shared your personal, your individual, or your family concerns relates to the air quality with your colleagues.
 
[participant #15]: Hmm, yeah, I believe so. Yeah, we talk about it. And you know, since it's an office, we kind of just all speak on the weathers at times, so that playing in part with it, we do go over, you know the circumstances, especially within other family members.
But yeah, I would say. It's a discussion that that I've had before.
 
S: Okay, is that discussion happens quite frequently.
 
[participant #15]: I wouldn't say quite frequently, but I mean it's still.
 
[participant #15]: It's still something that takes place almost quite frequently. So almost.
 
S: Be like, you know, especially there's a heavy dust wind, maybe.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah.
 
S: All people talk about the air right?
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, that's for sure.
 
S: I just curious that Are there any colleagues share their own personal or family concerns with you related to the air, quality.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, they have. But I mean. it's kind of hard to recount it. But I have heard some things from my colleagues especially regarding their families, and, you know, have having how the air is going to impact them.
 
S: Can you please share that? How your your friends or colleagues around you cope with a bad air quality.
So you said you could wear a mask, but I just curious how the other people cope with a bit bad air quality.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah. So I've also seen it where I mean, I asked my friend what they're gonna do today. And and they for the most part. They just say I'm staying in just because their quality is bad, or they would just rather not inhale it. So they try to stay home as as much as possible.
So that's that's one of the the big things that I feel like most people do here.
 
S: So if you have a appointment on certain day. And if there's a like bad air quality going on then do you experience, often canceling those meeting because of the air. Bad air quality. Do you have those incidents.
 
[participant #15]: Me. Personally, I won't cancel, but you know I know some people would like. Probably my sister. She would probably cancel just cause she's like that. She's very picky.
 
S: Okay, she is kind of concerned with the air quality and her health right?
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, pretty much.
 
 
S: So in some occasion people feel connected with each other when facing common challenges, like dealing with air quality in certain region, like in Bakersfield or people who's facing, you know, Wildfire in LA.
So I just wonder those kind of process also occur in Bakersfield around employees. So how did it feel when your colleagues are also experiencing similar challenges with air quality.
 
[participant #15]: Well, I feel like it's always good to hear that somebody's going through the same thing.
So I mean, if it's affecting me, and I know it's gonna affect them. So we just talk about it. And then we express our distaste for it, and we just it. In a way it feels. It makes us feel better because we're both going through it. And we're gonna have to eventually go outside and then breathe it in.
So I guess it's it's it. It makes us feel a little bit better, knowing that it's not just like enough thing. It's everybody else.
 
S: So some frustration from the air quality would be relieved if you share those concerns with your colleagues or friends. Right.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, for sure.
 
S: Okay. Great.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Question. Yeah, I understand. There's no doubt that dealing with air quality issues is very kind of tough and disaster. But just beyond knowing their struggles. Is there anything positive or upside that you guys are facing the common challenges, or something like that?
 
[participant #15]: Hmm.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Because you guys may talk about the same thing. And you guys might feel like you guys are in a common fate or something like that.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I mean. Honestly, it's kind of hard to find anything positive about it. just because the topic is so prevalent. You know, it's kind of hard to avoid it unless I mean, a mask kind of helps, but maybe something positive, probably giving each other tips, or maybe just cause usually say, the next day, it's suppose it's forecasted that it's also gonna be ha having bad air quality. If I'm not aware of that, usually they'll let me know beforehand. They'll tell me yeah. Well, tomorrow. It's also gonna be the same. So I guess that's a positive to it.
 
S: And you said, when you share concerns related to the air quality, you feel good and better and do you feel some connection with your colleagues. When you talk about the same challenges, you need to go through.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I feel like it brings us together in a way. Especially if they aren't from here.
I feel like it makes us closer, just because it's a it's a common thing, like I know somebody from Spain. And they'll tell me like, yeah, it sucks. But I mean at least we're going through it together. And and it's everybody around the county who feels it.
 
S: So there might be many discussion with the people around about air quality issue. Can you share any specific example or moment when you felt this sense of connection with the people when you talk about, you know, air quality.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I'd say, when I used to play soccer.
we would. Our practices would usually get canceled because of the bad air quality. So we would still talk over the phone and we would we would realize like, Oh, this, this is a pretty bad time, especially for our team right now.
But I mean, since we're all going through it, it's gonna be okay. Sometimes it would. It would even be that, like both practices in a week would get canceled, so we would just get together eventually on the weekend when the air quality would get better. And then it kind of just it's bonding through it in a way.
 
S: So I think you have shared a really valuable experiences that you are feeling connection, bonding with the people who who receives the same experiences.
So how has feeling more connected to others, influenced your thoughts related to the air pollution? So air pollution can influence the connection with others, and it could develop bonding. But with those feelings of connections, how that again influence your perspective related to the air pollution.
 
[participant #15]: Honestly, I would say that it made my perspective on the air quality. It kind of made it so that I wouldn't care about it, or I wouldn't think about it, and I wouldn't take it into mine. However, you know, this is something that you shouldn't do, and I'm glad that I grew past that, because, you know, everybody should take in mind that the air quality on certain days isn't the best.
So since I was bonding with these people. I was kind of getting accustomed to it. Even though you shouldn't, because at the end of the day it's it's something that's not good, and it's bad.
 
S: So let's move on to the next section. Talking about how your organization help their employees to cope with the air quality issue.
So what steps has your organization taken to address air quality issues? So, for example, it could be like distributing masks using air purifiers, as you said, or even planting trees or also adjusting work schedules based on the weather.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, so for [company X]. I know that our employees have to go in and out at times, so we'll provide masks. And it's hard, because sometimes, if it's that bad we'll just outright stop doing the the services, which is order pickup so we'll we'll cancel that. But I mean.
 
S: So there's that we'll we'll stop that process, and then we'll give them masks if it's if it's really that bad.
H: That's just to add to that. What's Are there certain standards in which you stop those services? Or is it just the decision made by the manager at the time.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah. So I I believe it would just have to come through from our our store director. Because he would have to make the the ultimate say.
But I mean, if if the conditions really are that bad like if it's if it's really flooding, or something like that, or their quality super bad, or it's really hot. Then I mean it's we kind of just have to
 
H: Understood.
 
S: How about in [university X]? You are working as a student workers. But I know you're involving. You are involved in many events and important. you know, activities. So are there any steps that see us to be taken to address air quality issues.
 
[participant #15]: Honestly, I haven't seen anything. Maybe they'll send out in a like a warning. But other than that, I haven't really seen much.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: If I remember correctly, you mentioned that your school provides some information about the belly fever for the students right.
So I'm curious. Do they mainly share, like basic information? What like. what belly fever is, and how, where, where it comes from, something like that? Or do they offer some guide on how to prevent the belly fever, and like? Or they provide some specific resources or medical help to deal with those problems.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, so they list like the symptoms. They list ways to try to prevent it where it comes from. How it can be confused with something like a common cold at times, or how many, many people from the county might even have the the fungus already in their lungs. It's just that they haven't gone out to the to go seek it.
So it it just depends because they mentioned that when they go to the doctor sometimes, since it gets confused with the common cold. They won't test for it, so that's where it can get lost. Unless it gets severely triggered. But yeah, they they give out a good amount of information for that. It's just that you have to actively seek it. It's not something that I feel like it's shared a lot with us.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: I see. Do they provide more like specific resources? So something like a medical checkup or. Test. something like that.
 
[participant #15]: I don't know if our student health services provides it. I'm not sure how about in [company X]
 
S: Do. They are flexible with the work schedule. You know, sensitivity. regarding the air quality might be quite different across each employee, and each employee would like to escape certain day for work if the air quality is not good. But does your workplace or manager accommodate those needs.
 
[participant #15]: We? Yeah, we can be very accommodating. However, it gets to a point depending on how reliable the person is. Then we would, we would try to see how that's affecting them.
 
[participant #15]: But I feel like we are accommodating in the moment, and then when they do show up again. We'll have a conversation with them, and we'll explain like.
Your reliability hasn't been the best. Is there a way that maybe you can drop your desired hours since you've been missing a lot of work. But we'll we'll we'll accommodate. It's just that in the grand scheme of things. We'll. We'll then look into the bigger picture and try to get them closer to less hours if they're not willing to work. That is.
 
S: Regarding your organization's actions, especially in a [company X] and organizations inaction, especially in [university X].
Regarding the air quality, I mean can you please share your general thought about their action and inaction?
 
[participant #15]: Okay. Well, I know. [company X] has some initiatives to give back to the community. I know. Just yesterday. They were at one of the parks, cleaning up, however, for [university X]. I know they stress it, but it's kind of hard for them to to do more with it.
But you know, I I think that's that's mainly what what both organizations do it. It's just hard.
 
S: Have your concerns about air quality changed because of your organization's efforts.
 
[participant #15]: I'd say for [university X]. I think it's helped me worry more about it.
Just because I have heard from other. You know, student workers how much it really does affect us. So I think in a way, it has played a part.
 
S: So you are more aware of the valley fever right.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I'm more aware now and back then. I used to not care as much, but now I'm
: I'm privy to it, so I think it's it's better this way.
 
S: Okay, how about [company X]'s efforts regarding air quality? Does that change your concern about air quality?
 
[participant #15]: Well, I haven't really seen much, so I don't. I wouldn't say so.
But yeah, I probably wouldn't, wouldn't say so. I don't think it would affect me for that.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's really interesting. Do you think that the more people learn about air quality issue and problems or belly fever, something like that? Do you think the more vulnerable they might actually feel about the air quality issues or challenges.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I I do think so. I feel like the more that somebody gets educated on it.
They'll realize how it's affecting their daily lives. But if they don't want to learn, or they just ignore those facts, then they're just not gonna care. they're not going to be as as aware of what they're really feeling, because if you take note of what's happening in the county, you'll see how it has already affected the way you live.
 
S: That's good.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Really interesting. Do you know anyone around you who doesn't really worry about air quality issue? Because maybe just because they do not know about it, and they do not have much information about those symptoms or disease.
 
[participant #15]: I'd say I do know some people, but I feel like it's more just that since they've lived here for 20 years and all their lives.
I feel like that's why. So they they're just so accustomed to it. They don't even realize that it's basically shaped the way they live and I feel like if they go somewhere else, and they live there for a while, they'll notice that it's way different.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thank you.
 
S: have your feelings of connections to your organizations changed, based on how it has addressed air quality issues.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I think that if I'm with a company that doesn't acknowledge what's going on in our local community, I feel like that would strain me from from the company just because I feel like it's so important for an organization to give back to the community that it's in. So I'm glad that [university X] and and [company X] is at least aware of it. And it it lets employees know that what we're going through is what everyone else is going through and they try to help out with wherever they can. So yeah, I I believe it could cause that.
 
S: Okay. Great. Great. And what kinds of support or initiatives do you think your organizations could provide to better address air quality concerns?
 
[participant #15]: I think that they could, you know, like, I said post more information about air quality. Maybe, like the index, they can provide information about valley fever. give warnings whenever their quality is bad. I think these things, even though they're small, they do help if they're more prevalent. More people can get educated on the issue.
So I think that's just the 1st steps to it, and that that's something they could do.
 
S: Do you think the organization can help making the air quality better.
 
[participant #15]: I'm sure they they could.
I just don't know how they would do it and like logistic wise, but I feel like. If they had the money, it should be something that they're they would they should try to do just because sometimes these organizations play a part in causing the bad air quality at times, but I know, like something like for the oil companies here that could they should reinvest and try to mitigate as much as they cause the problems here.
 
S: Correct.
 
S: considering the current air quality issues. Do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area? Long term.
 
[participant #15]: I? Well, my goals aren't for Bakersfield, but I mean. I wouldn't mind it. I think Bakersfield. Besides, the air quality is is a good city, but you know that is one of the heavy drawbacks to it is is the air quality, especially if you're gonna be raising children.
That's probably one of the bad parts about it. So it it might affect my long term. But yeah.
 
S: Okay, this is the last question, and we value you're sharing your experiences. It was really helpful for us to understand how air quality impact our employees. Thank you.
And is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with air, quality and community connections in Sun Hawking Valley that we haven't discussed.
 
[participant #15]: I'd say that growing up it was.
It was something weird, but it was something that was kind of the norm was seeing somebody's nose bleed. Because of the bad air quality. That's something that I grew up seeing. And it would be like, Yeah, this is this is just something that happens whenever I'm outside, and their quality is bad. So that's something that would happen. And I would see on occasion.
 
S: Okay, Hoon and song. Do you have any other questions?
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: I do have one last question. Since you have live in Bakersfield for your entire life has your perspective on the air quality issue changed during that time like looking back. And would you say your thinking has changed, or shift compared to how you saw it in the past when you are young, when you're young.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah. So when I was younger I feel like I was more ignorant towards it. I would probably just say like. Oh, I don't care. But as we know this this mindset is isn't good, but as I've grown I've got more educated on the issue, and I feel deeply about it now. Compared to back then. But I mean growing up. The norm was that we always had bad air quality. That's what everybody would would stress. So yeah, my mindset has definitely changed towards it.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, of course, our thoughts and views can naturally evolve over time. Especially if we learn about it. But was there any specific moment or event or conversation that really cause that change for you maybe, can be the company's effort, or it can be your like. Daily conversation with your friends.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah. So I believe around in high school I had this teammate who I would play soccer with. However, he randomly was gone from school, for I believe, a week or 2, and when he came back I asked him why he was gone, and he he basically just told me that he was in the hospital because his like valley fever had gone so bad. so that kind of just changed it for me. So it really helped me realize how dramatic it it was.
 
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's helpful. Thanks for sharing.
 
S: Okay, thanks for your valuable opinion. And if you have other folks who want to join this interview. please help us to you know, sharing this opportunity with them.
 
[participant #15]: So would. If I do get somebody, would you just want them to email you directly Dr. Pack.
 
S: Yes.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, okay.
 
S: Any any folks who works who is currently working.
 
S: And also who feels air quality is bad, would helpful for this interview. I had interviewed some employees.
 
S: but they didn't provide many valuable, you know, opinion because they were. They were not concerned with the air quality.
 
[participant #15]: Hmm.
 
S: Any of the these questions were not valid.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, I mean I could probably ask my brother he's
 
[participant #15]: somebody who's who's seen firsthand how it affects them.
 
S: okay. Great. Great.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah.
 
S: So once, he sent me an email and I will send the potential available time. And along those time he could pick.
 
S: Okay, we can have the interview alright, thanks for coming, and I hope to see you around in the campus, and possibly next semester.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah, of course, I look forward to that. Thank you for everything to all of you.
 
S: Thank you. And can you share your personal email other than Csv email.
 
[participant #15]: Yeah. So it's Alfredo.
 
S: In the chat. Can you please share? Yeah, I don't. I just want to make a mistake and send a gift card to this. The wrong person.
 
[participant #15]: No worries. I'm also new.
