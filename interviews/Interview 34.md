## Transcript
S: Hello, P34!
P34: Hi! How are you?
S: Good! How are you?
P34: I'm doing well.
S: Thanks for joining us.
P34: Yeah, of course.
S: before we start our meeting. I just wanted to let you know that you will receive $40 Amazon gift card right after this interview.
P34: Okay. Cool. Thank you.
S: No problem. And this research is supported by CSUB and we received $10,000 research grant recently.
S: Oh, and that's how I have invited my co-authors Sung Hyoun Hong from Georgia State University.
P34: All right.
S: Dr. Lee, from Loyola Marymount University.
P34: Awesome.
P34: Okay.
S: And the interview will be take within 45 minutes.
S: Okay, and
S: for the transcription purpose we are currently recording. But if you're not comfortable. We cannot record.
P34: That's fine. Yeah, it should be okay.
S: Okay, thank you very much. We will not go beyond your experiences around air quality issue in Kern county. So I think the questions, my, will be comfortable for you if I look back of my around 30 interviews with the employees in Kern county.
P34: Okay.
S: Okay, P34, can you tell us about your current role in your job?
P34: Right now I work. No, no.
P34: sorry. I have my daughters with me.
S: Totally okay.
S: I have 3 kids and my baby, she's 3 years old. She's around me.
P34: Oh, okay, but right now I work. I work in a restaurant. I'm like a line cook.
P34: I've worked there a couple of years, probably 4 years, but before that I did, about a year and a half I worked in in the oil fields as confined space rescue. So we were on every job site, basically in case of emergency and it was always outdoors. It was always in the heat. And the
P34: this wonderful Kern county air we have.
S: Okay, since. I think you have a very valuable experiences which is quite related to air quality. So can you, when you talk about your experiences around air quality issue, can you look back when you experience, or when you work at the oil field?
P34: Yeah, so it was, I mean, it's it doesn't rain a lot. So it's always dusty, usually out there. And we always had to have like air quality tests right inside the confined space and outside for our sake.
P34: So it was, I mean, they had us as safe as possible, but it was still. We always had to wear like masks even out there in the fields, just because the air quality, when it was hot, which in Bakersfield most of the months of the year hot. So
P34: I mean, we always had to wear the masks, just because, like all the spores in the like in the dirt, in the air.
P34: They just wanted us as safe as possible.
S: it's interesting that some of our interviewees were working at the agriculture company and their company only checked temperature,
S: and if the temperatures go beyond a certain limit. They cannot work, but in your workplace your company checked both temperature and air quality.
P34: We had to check the air quality because of the possible H2S. Around the
P34: around the like the machines we're working.
P34: So it's like, if the the H2S all right.
P34: if the parts per million H2S were too high, we weren't. We had to basically get out of there.
P34: But we did have to check the the heat, and I think inside we no business. I'm sorry.
P34: If it was hot enough. We were only able to work 15 minutes for every hour, and that's usually like above
P34: like above a hundred degrees.
P34: So the jobs in the summer usually took a lot longer like, for, like it usually took days longer, because,
P34: like in a total, we were only allowed to work maybe a few hours
P34: like actually on the machine, or wherever we were near.
P34: But yeah, so they we always had H2S monitors on every helmet, like we were required to wear them.
P34: So
P34: yeah, they had to always have the air they always had that, you know, the air quality checked like around each person.
S: Oh, so that's quite interesting. I didn't know that the air quality sensor has attached to each of the individuals’ helmet.
S: and while you are
P34: Not permitted to work are you still paid?
P34: Yeah. So as long as we're on the job site for whatever hours we are there. We were paid.
S: Okay? Great. 
P34: Yeah.
S: Can you walk us through a typical day? Just looking back when you work at that old school company.
P34: Yeah.
S: So, including your working hours, and also after and before working hours.
P34: So I was required to be
P34: at at the work where we got into our work truck at 4:30 in the morning. So we were there early, and usually we had to be at the job site around 6 or whenever they required us.
P34: But I worked at [company name], and we had our own confined space truck that we use to get to and from work.
P34: And
P34: that's where we had, like all of our like, our tripod, all of our safety equipment was in the truck and
P34: We would work anywhere from Lost Hills to San Ardo out by Paso Robles. So we were like pretty much everywhere.
P34: And we would get to the job site. It usually, we could get like we're there for 8 hours unless
P34: the other workers wanted to be wanted to get the job done. In that aspect, it would just be kind of mandatory overtime because they needed a safety guys there
P34: while people were working inside the confined space.
P34: But it was usually about 8 hours, and then we would go back to our office
P34: and finish up whatever like paperwork we had like about the job
P34: cause we worked for 10 hours days, so like it was when we got to work at 4:30,
P34: and then usually around 2:30. If we skipped our lunch or a 3:30, we would be off
P34: like if we had a lunch.
P34: and then, after that is just head home, and I always showered as soon as I got home, because I was always sweaty or dusty.
S: After you get home. How did you, how did you relax?
P34: Usually, it was before I had kids, so I was able to take a nap, and it was like in the middle of the afternoon like an A/C. That's it was probably about an hour nap, and then
P34: we have exercise equipment like in our garage. I would. After that I would exercise and take another shower usually.
S: Okay, how long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley?
P34: So
P34: I've lived in Bakersfield since 2015. I came here for school at Cal State, Bakersfield, and I've lived here since then.
S: Before then where did you live?
P34: I was in the Antelope Valley. So I was in Lancaster. That's where I grew up. I was born on [name of a place] and
P34: I kind of moved around when I was real little, but spent most of my life in Lancaster.
S: Hmm, okay. So it seems like you're the right person who could compare between, you know Bakersfield, hey?
S: And the other region like Antelope Valley?.
S: How do you feel about the air quality? And Bakersfield compared to Lancaster?
P34: Well, Lancaster had a lot of wind because they were in the valley like between Rosemont and and right by Palmdale. So there was a lot of wind always, so there was a good amount of pollen constantly in the air. I remember always having allergies, but here in Bakersfield, it's more of a dry heat.
P34: And it's still.
P34: It's hard to breathe in dry heat, and especially with
P34: like I know I don't have it, but I I know people that have lived here long that have had valley fever because of like the spores in the air. I know that's like a big
P34: a big deal with like the air in the the San Joaquin Valley.
S: How they should know that you, how they should know, when they should know about belly fever, and how they should know about belly fever?
P34: When I moved to Bakersfield.
P34: My one of my close friends, Dad. He works at the the prison over here. He's one of the doctors in the prison, and he told me about it.
P34: and he just told me it's because of how dry the like. All the dirt is, and it's all all the spores in the ground. And then, when I met, I met my wife, and she had it, and my father-in-law had it. I think, in 2012 they both got it.
S: So first you heard from your friend's dad, who's doctor, and then
S: you had indirectly experienced valley fever because of your close family.
P34: Yes, yeah, my, my father-in-law was,
P34: He was in the hospital. His his lungs are still scarred. My wife
P34: she grew up with asthma. So she was like already, at risk
P34: but she she doesn't have like as bad
P34: like issues right now that my father-in-law has. He's
P34: he he said he used to exercise a lot, and now he can't as much.
S: Because of that experience. How did your perspective on air quality in Bakersfield changed.
P34: I
P34: what right when I moved here like I was used to exercising outside when I lived in Lancaster, and I like to run outside and like when I moved here.
P34: I was doing that, and then
P34: I was told, it's it's not safe, and
P34: I'm not really one to wear a mask while exercising, and I know that's the safest, if you want to, if that's how you want to do it outdoors. So I
P34: I got like a Gym membership, and I went to the CSUB gym like in person inside, and I did most of my exercising inside after that.
S: So, looking back, would you say you're thinking about, you know, air quality issue
S: has shifted compared to how you saw it in the past?
P34: I think so definitely because I
P34: I mean it it seems like every summer is hotter and lasts longer than the last, and that's
P34: at least when I feel like the air quality is the worst, when it's as hot as possible. So I,
P34: I can definitely see a growing trend
P34: like in the air quality, getting worse and worse.
S: So in what ways do air quality conditions affect your daily activities right now?
P34: I don't like being outside, like even swimming, like I can tell.
P34: I
P34: it's hard to explain, I I can tell when the air is like good versus bad, and on on the worst days we do try to stay inside. We change our our air conditioning air filters
P34: like every two months instead of I think it's supposed to do it every three to six. We try to change them as often as possible.
P34: In our cars, too. We change the cabin air filter in the the A/C like filter.
P34: As often as possible.
S: Is that because of your newborn child?
P34: It. It happens probably when our first born, my my other daughter, is a two and a half.
P34: and we started like really focusing more.
P34: At least I'm kind of fortifying the house with changing the
P34: like. The air filters more often to keep it as clean as possible. We have.
P34: like multiple fans in our house, ceiling fans and ground fans and
P34: in each room we have an air purifier as well. So we we try to keep it as as nice in the house as we can as breathable.
S: Hmm.
S: Has air quality ever affected your work, productivity, or attendance? Can you talk about your experiences both when you worked in oil field and also your current job?
P34: Well in the oil field, I remember when we had our we had
P34: when we have multiple, long days in a row, I could tell that I I would have to. I had to go to the doctor and get like an Albuterol rescue inhaler twice that year. Just
P34: I mean, it helps like open the airways up. But I remember it was, I, I believe, once was in April of that year, and once was right after the summer, I think in August or September.
P34: just because it was just so many hot days, and being outside for hours at a time.
P34: And this, the job that I'm currently at.
P34: Okay.
P34: we use. We, we had two locations and the other location had a patio. So the more I was in and out of our patio it was worse.
P34: But I it's it's better like where I'm at now at our one location, because it's all indoors.
P34: So it's I'm usually in the A/C most of the day, or like in the kitchen by our filters in the kitchens.
S: Was the, what was the reason? What was the reason you changed the location of your workplace was, it was the main reason was the one of the one main reason was the air quality?
P34: Yeah from the oil fields to where I'm at now?
P34: It was. That was one thing, being, the air quality was was bad, and it was like it was hard being up very early and not having the same hours of my wife.
P34: So it was. Those were probably the two main reasons, the air quality, and then just being able to spend more time with my family.
S: Okay, so you said when you feel sick, you went to the doctor and bought inhaler, and was was those cost reimbursed by the company?
P34: No, because I had I I had my insurance at the time, and it was I believe my, I only paid $5 when I went to the pharmacy and got it.
P34: I believe both times, yeah, all right.
S: Have you noticed that the air quality also impacted others around you, except your, you know, wife and your in-law?
P34: I know when I was when I was working in the oil field there was always
P34: workers that constantly wore their masks even like at work, because that where our office was it was half outdoors, half indoors and
P34: I, coworkers mostly, but I don't know if I've had any friend, any other friends or family.
S: Okay, so when you work at the oil field company, how comfortable are people in your workplace, with discussing air quality concerns.
P34: I think they were pretty comfortable about it, because we were always trained with, like the dangerous gases in the oil fields. We also.
P34: Well, we talked a lot about like the the air quality like in the air, wherever we were as well.
S: Hmm, okay.
S: How about the people outside of the company? Do you think they are also comfortable? Talking about the air quality issue?
P34: I think so. I think if it's been brought up around me, no one, I I don't think anyone's been uncomfortable that I've noticed.
P34: and it's I mean, most people that I know complain about the heat and the air quality in Bakersfield. So it's
P34: I, I feel like everyone that at least that I've known is okay with it.
S: The one of the reason I ask you is that some of the interviewees said, when they started to talk about their complaints, about the air quality in Bakersfield. Some of the people are connecting that with a political discussion. So in order to avoid political discussion, they just don't want to talk about start about complaining air quality issue. So that's why I asked that.
P34: I I mean, I haven't. Personally, I guess I can understand. If people want to complain like we need more EV vehicles or something and like the initiatives to get more EV in California. But I no one that I've known is has said anything like that really.
S: Okay. Have you ever shared your personal or family concerns related to air quality with your colleagues?
P34: I have mentioned it.
P34: Cause I, my other colleagues, when I was working the oil fields, they
P34: at least one of them has lived in Bakersfield his whole life
P34: and he, he always complained about the heat and the air quality, and I.
S: He knows that I I have family members that have that have had valley fever because of the air quality.
P34: But other than that specific one person. I haven't really talked about it.
S: What was the reason why you had talked about the air quality issue with the people, you know,
S: for with someone, but not with the people, with the other person. What? What was the big difference between those two group.
P34: I mean, when I was working I spent more hours with the guy that I I guess I talked to it about and
P34: my other direct coworker was kind of like the supervisor, so he wasn't on every single job that we were on.
P34: So I just I think it's just I spent more time with, like my direct coworker that I talked with him about.
S: Okay.
S: Did talking about the air quality issue actually make you feel bond or having more connection, sense of connection with that people?
P34: I think so. Yeah, it's better to,
P34: I don't know, I I felt like closer, because we have a little bit more in common for it.
S: Some people think that if you complain about the air quality issue because your you know health issue, they don't want to reveal that because it is the one of the indicator that they are revealing their. You know, vulnerability. Have you ever thought about that?
P34: I haven't really, because I
P34: I grew up with asthma as well. I kind of grew out of it in high school, but I remember having to use like nebulizers and inhalers when I was young, so I I never felt like it was feeling vulnerable about that. I I never had any issues talking about it.
P34: cause I feel like if
P34: if more people know about it, then it's
P34: I don't know, it it can't hurt that more people know about it, I guess.
S: Yeah.
S: since you're from outside of the Bakersfield, when you meet with the person who has born in born and raised in Bakersfield. Have you feel that? Their, you know, attitude toward air quality quality issue in Bakersfield is quite different from you.
P34: I think so. I think the people like, especially my wife. She was born here, and and my father-in-law has been here since. I believe the eighties
P34: they, they constantly gripe about it. And I I kind of just moved here like 8 years ago, and I just
P34: or or a little bit more than that, but they they hate with like a passion. They they don't like the air quality, so
P34: I guess he's a little more with the, like the native people from from Bakersfield and San Joaquin Valley.
S: Have you? Have you ever thought that people who are born and raised here in Bakersfield? They are more resilient to the air quality issue, or they are a little bit more, you know.
S: less sensitive about the air quality.
P34: Like from a medical standpoint, or
S: Or just in the perspective, you know, complaining the issue.
P34: I think they're resilient about it, like I I do think they are. They they'll always, I mean the people that I know will keep complaining, but
P34: they're like strongly for complaining about it.
S: Okay, have you ever want to take mask?
S: But hesitant to wear it because of the social pressure around you?
P34: I have. Yeah, I've did I, 
P34: Because where I'm at, where I work right now, I do the shopping for our restaurant as well, and I'm I'm in and out of stores, and like every morning
P34: and in the summer, I'm not really afraid of
P34: at least wearing it like into the store and out. But I like when I'm driving in the car, like even I'm
P34: like, when I see people with the mask in the car like, why are they wearing their mask in the car? But I I can understand. But I I can feel a little pressure sometimes with the mask.
P34: Hmm!
S: So you you have some pressure to wear a mask or not to wear a mask.
P34: To not wear a mask, I guess, in the car.
P34: Yeah.
S: Okay.
S: For our next question. So
S: Sometimes people feel a sense of connection with others. If they face some common challenges like air quality, it affects people in Bakersfield, whether they are rich or poor, or aged or young. Right?
S: So when you learn that the others share similar environmental concerns like heat or air, quality issue or dust,
S: How does that affect you?
P34: Well, I I think it. It just affects me more in a positive way, like if everyone's.
P34: I guess, complaining about it's kind of like a sense of community like, at least we all know the same issue that everyone else is facing
P34: cause I mean a lot of people throughout the day.
P34: So I don't think it's a negative thing that people talk about or complain about it.
S: Do you think that that sense, that sense of connection, lead to other positive things?
P34: Oh, I think possibly I mean, if
P34: I don't really know how to fix the problem. But if it can possibly get to
P34: the let the right legislators that could make the right changes, or
P34: I think if enough people talk about it, it could get to the right people and possibly make changes.
S: Hmm.
S: How about this? Do you think that sharing concerns about the air pollutions or quality has helped you feel more connected to your organization?
P34: I haven't really thought about it.
S: How about connection with the community?
P34: I can see that. Yeah, I think so.
P34: It can make me feel better about the or feel closer to the like. The people around me. And I mean, if everyone has the same issue, then I will definitely feel like a part of it, like in a positive way.
S: How how has feeling we're connected to the others influenced your thoughts, related to the air quality?
P34: I mean it. It makes me think like, yeah, there, there definitely is a problem. And to not feel like the negative pressure about wearing a mask if I have to be outside or like for prolonged like periods of time. So I
P34: I think it's like it's good in that sense.
S: Hmm.
S: We talked about sense of community when we share, you know, environmental risk with other people. But
S: did you have any moment or time that you,
S: you know, feel like the other did not, you know, understand your situation around dealing with the air quality issue and felt isolated?
P34: Maybe when, like, if talking to someone, I
P34: I do remember mentioning that like I'm it's like new, this poor air quality to me, because I
P34: like, while the Antelope Valley had a lot of wind and like pollen in the air, it wasn't as detrimental as like the spores over here like like as much dust as we have over here.
P34: And it was just kind of new
P34: to the people I was talking to that like I didn't have like these air quality issues. But I wasn't. I didn't feel like isolated because of it, like it was
P34: when I was talking to that person who was like a friend. They didn't make me feel like that about it. They were just kind of surprised that I've never really had the air quality issues.
S: In that moment, did you want to elaborate more to make them understand about the issue in Bakersfield or just stop talking about about that matter?
P34: I, if I remember, I I think I just stopped talking about it.
S: Okay.
S: Have you ever felt like you're the only one person who's worried about the air quality while others seem unbothered?
P34: I I think we're definitely in the minority
P34: the people that are worried about the air because I mean, a lot of people
P34: probably couldn't, I couldn't care, couldn't care less. So I I think so. Yeah.
S: Okay? I think. You mentioned a really good point. I also agree with that. So you mentioned minority. So in our society. We. There's a small group that supports minority groups like, you know Hispanic or Black or LGBTQ.
S: But I haven't seen much about the group who who supports
S: people who's quite sensitive to the air quality issue in Bakersfield.
P34: Yeah.
S: So do you think that those kind of group could.
S: Help them to, you know, understand their situation and overcome their, you know, environmental risk?
P34: I think they could. I mean it doesn't hurt anybody.
P34: Just for people to be kind like if someone wants to wear a mask like, don't shame them for it like for any reason, because I
P34: I've heard people like shame people for wanting to wear a mask, especially for after COVID. But I've I've seen in like people that want to wear masks because of the air quality as well.
P34: And I've I've heard people being shamed because they want to wear the mask in nice.
P34: I don't think that's that gets anyone anywhere. So I I think that could definitely be changed.
S: Hmm.
S: Do you think that your
S: you are belong to the group who is concerned with the air quality in Bakersfield?
P34: I think so. Yeah.
S: And you think that the number of the size of the group is quite.
S: Minor compared to other people?
P34: I think, so, yeah, yeah.
S: How do you think about that, you know, sensitivity,
S: the air quality issue is quite different across people.
P34: I think a lot of people don't don't even think about it like it's
P34: it's not really something they could see like the air unless they, you know, they work outside and they they're in it like every day or multiple days a week. They don't
P34: really think about it if they work inside, or if they don't have any loved ones or friends that work like outdoors, it's just
P34: it doesn't really cross their mind. I don't believe.
S: Because they cannot see. So that's.
P34: Me, and.
S: That's.
P34: Oh, yeah.
S: Not, believe.
P34: Yeah.
S: Okay, it's a really interesting point, because.
S: I feel like the people who doesn't feel like they are affected by the air quality. They think that the people who are concerned with their air quality is like a religion.
P34: Oh, jeez, yeah, like a make or break. Yeah.
S: When you cannot discuss these concerns like air quality issue openly, how does how does that affect your confidence in your own experiences?
P34: I don't know if it really wanes my confidence as much.
P34: If I ever bring it up like the fact that the air quality isn't.
P34: I don't know isn't as it should, and someone doesn't
P34: either doesn't care or doesn't even share my like my opinions,
P34: I'd probably just leave it alone.
P34: That's why I think it's like good to have like, I guess, like-minded people like, yeah.
S: Have you ever wished you could find more people who share similar worries about air, quality.
P34: Yeah, yeah, I have. It would be nice like, the more people the better.
P34: The yeah. the more people that talk about the issue the better.
S: So if you find more people who's concerned with the air quality issue, how do you think that could change change you emotionally?
P34: I think it would be like a positive like action. I'm so sorry about.
P34: I think it would be like a positive emotional change. Like to find more people. Cause it would, I mean, like, I said earlier, would be like more sense of a community, and it's like a,
P34: it feels feels good to be not like alone in your views. I guess.
S: So in
S: in that sense, what kind of support or initiative do you think that your organization, or, you know, other organization could provide to their employees to better.
P34: address
P34: or deal with the air quality concerns?
P34: I think.
P34: I guess. Just like team meetings.
P34: specifically talking about the like, the air quality
P34: just to make sure everyone gets heard like the same information, or gets told the same information. And
P34: so everyone's kind of on the same page. I think that would be very, very beneficial.
S: So providing them a objective, you know, data or information so that everyone can be on the same page.
P34: Yeah.
S: Other than that. Do you suggest any other, you know suggestion to the organization?
P34: I mean, if they are able. I'm just. I'm trying to think
P34: it's like any ways of getting the the same information to as many people as possible doesn't have to necessarily be a meeting. It could be an email or some sort of
P34: newsletter.
P34: I'm trying to think I'm trying to think like, when I was in the oil fields we had classes we had to take like on the safety of of the H2S. like the like, the bad gases, and like just all the safety classes.
P34: I don't know if companies would have to make it mandatory, or
P34: they could say, like, you don't have to be here. But
P34: I think if it was at least mandatory, everyone, everyone would have all the same information you know.
S: Okay.
S: Considering the current air quality issues in Bakersfield, do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area for long term?
P34: We have talked about moving like our 5 to 10 year plans. We have, 
P34: and it has been a big factor, the air quality. It's like one of our top factors about moving.
S: Okay, is it because of your kids?
P34: Yeah, my, because my wife grew up here. She grew up with the asthma and eventually got valley fever. She she doesn't want our kids, I mean, I don't either. But she has more, more reasons not to, because she knows what valley fever is like.
S: I think that's a hard decision, because your wife's family lives in Bakersfield.
P34: Hmm.
P34: They I mean, I know they complain about it a lot, too. I just they.
P34: They've been here since the eighties, so I don't know
P34: if they'd be as comfortable like moving, but I
P34: I don't know. It's kind of like a we'll cross that bridge in a few years when we get to it type of deal.
S: What changes would make you feel more optimistic about living and working in Bakerfield
S: for long term?
P34: Well, if I mean my
P34: both my daughters are are young, and they're not in school yet, but if if every if every classroom could have some sort of a
P34: like an air purifier or two, depending on how big the rooms are.
P34: I think that would help more air purifiers in either private or public schools like,
P34: because when it comes to
P34: middle school and high school kids start to have lockers, and they're in and out of each classroom. So they're like in out in the air more times throughout the day than like elementary
P34: and not mandatory math at recess, but maybe a little more information for the parents. About like the possibilities, or like.
P34: maybe if some kids are cruel and make fun of the kids that want to wear masks? Just so all the parents have the information as well to let their kids know it's okay. If other kids want to wear masks or
S: Hmm.
P34: or not.
P34: Great stuff like that.
S: Yeah, I'm curious that the us, currently, I'm living in Magic Mountain.
S: Yeah. Okay.
S: LA county. Yeah. Most
S: because of my kids. And I learned that my kids need to do multiple times of recess while they are in the elementary school. No matter how the air quality is bad or not, they should go outside. But how do you know about that, you know information?
P34: That the kids had to go outside.
P34: I'm pretty sure I have. I have friends that are teachers, and they teach elementary specifically.
P34: It's I believe it's like the teachers mandatory break time that they're supposed to get throughout the day. So that's like their 30 minutes, and then an afternoon 30 minutes and then lunch. So I I figured that's when the kids go on recess. That's the teachers’ mandatory breaks they're supposed to get.
S: Okay, I just curious, because if.
P34: Oh, yeah.
S: Is the kind of rare information only some parents know. So.
P34: Yeah, yeah.
S: Okay for the last question. But before that Hoon or Sung Hyoun, do you have any question for P34?
S: For last question. You know, we are currently doing this interview, and we need to do for more people. So are there any questions
S: You might think that I can give to the person
S: for the following interviews?
P34: I'm thinking I did like your question about. Would it impact the
P34: choosing to stay living here or move? That was one of my favorite questions you had today. I have family that moved out of state.
P34: Not necessarily because of the air quality, but like we do have other options for family like out of state.
P34: But we haven't talked much about like possibly moving from here.
P34: But I'm trying to think, I think, because a lot of people are parents. The questions about kids are really important.
P34: So I, I focus on those. Probably most.
S: Okay.
P34: It's just.
S: Thank you very much. And this is it for today's interview and after this interview we will conduct a survey after you know September and
S: October, when the airport is relatively bad compared to other season, so can I contact you for conducting a weekly survey.
