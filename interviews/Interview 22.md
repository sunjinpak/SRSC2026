S: Hello! P22
P22: Hi, doctor, how are you doing.
S: Pretty good. How are you?
P22: Well, I'm well.
S: You have new mustache, cool.
P22: Thank you.
S: To grow one, but it never grows.
S: Okay. How's your life with the new family?
S: It's great, it's great.
S: Alright! 
P22: Baby's growing works, good and.
P22: Yeah, it's been. It's been really well.
S: Okay, that's great. And you have also a window office.
P22: Yes.
S: I remember that my 1st job at Pennsylvania we had. I had no window in my office.
S: Actually it was a office with a partition between 2 rooms.
S: But yeah, but now I have it so.
P22: Yeah, there, you go.
S: Okay? So here's Sunyan, home from Georgia State University. And we are conducting a research how air quality and Bakersfield impact employees in Kern county.
S: But not only that. How it could facilitate kind of community kind of connection between the people who experience the same difficulties.
P22: No problem.
S: So like. So
S: I'm investigating research on how the bad environment could provide positive and negative impact. So so that's why
S: I'm conducting this research. And you know, so for this research
S: we are. I just wanted to let you know that.
S: Do you mind if we take a recording of this interview and.
P22: Not at all. Go ahead.
S: Thank you very much. After that we will transcribe it, because Zoom transcribes automatically, and we will delete the recording as well.
P22: Oh, no worries.
S: Okay? And also in the transcribe. In the transcription. I will delete and replace all the information that could detect your personal identification like P22, or or you know, some company, name or neighbor. So we just want to make sure that we follow the
S: the proposal we have sent to CSUB before we conduct this research.
P22: Okay. Thank you.
S: Okay, thanks. And after this research we will send you a $40 Amazon gift card, and I'll give you each for your Joanna and you. Thanks for participating both of you. I really appreciate that.
P22: Yeah, definitely, if you if you guys ever need other subjects for your guys research, definitely, let me let me know. I have lots of lots of coworkers, lots of individuals.
S: That would be great. We never ask about, you know private things.
S: So.
S: Just your feeling and experience from the air quality. So
S: it would be great if you can, you know.
S: introduce this research, or, you know compensation opportunity to your friends. We need 20 more interviewees.
S: And yeah, thanks for your help.
P22: Yeah, I'll definitely let them know, and I'll also I'll give them your your contact information.
S: Okay, thank you.
S: First of all, could you tell us about your current role in your job?
P22: Yes. So I'm currently a credit analyst, RMDP. RMDP stands for relationship manager development program. And eventually I'll be promoting to a relationship manager. Underneath the commercial business banking sector. And I'm currently going to be inheriting my own loan portfolio as of today. I do a lot of deals regarding like lines of credits. We also do a lot of like commercial buildings, large buildings like the one behind me. We could finance for individuals.
P22: Multi-million dollar deals and we finance those for for individuals. Companies depending. Whatever the need is, we could customize a product package and lend it out to somebody.
P22: So in my current status I assist with those projects in my new status. I'll be managing my own portfolio and having to bring those types of loans in for for the bank as well.
S: Okay, I think it's a really important job that could make possible to someone run their own business.
P22: Yes.
S: And does that require your physical presence in your office, or do you need to be there in the building when you work?
S: Are there any flexibility to wear indoors or outdoors.
P22: Okay, yeah, no. My job is very flexible. I could work from wherever I need to. So I have 2 offices. I have one in the Riverwalk location, and I have one here at the downtown location. And there's times where I could work from home. If I have a contractor at home working out on certain products for me. I could definitely be at home and work from home. If I need client meetings, I take them out for lunch. So I I am basically everywhere. Restaurants people's offices, people's companies, business offices,
P22: umm…in the bank, in the branch, just depending where I need to be at.
S: It seems like your salary is, depend on the outcome of your work. Not
S: depend on the process you are taking.
P22: It's a mixture of both. So there's bonuses. And then there's also a salary
P22: Credit analysts can make anywhere between 75 to 85. And then relationship managers can make anywhere between 120 up to like 200,000 and plus their.
S: Okay.
S: Great, great job. It sounds like an ideal job for me.
P22: It's a lot of work. I will say that it is very, very intensive work. It's a process from the beginning, all the way to the end. We work with escrow companies, title companies. We have to work with companies that are, you know, busy individuals as well. So we need to be on top of them to provide us all the financials, because we're doing, apart from the law maintenance part of it, I'm also doing the underwriting side of it, so I underwrite every single deal.
S: Oh!
P22: It comes through my my table. Yeah.
S: Okay, I realize that. Why, Marty, recommend you to be a president of Finance Club.
S: I wish you had. We have similar type of good student in SHRM organization, yeah, yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Just quick question. I think you have, like great level of flexibility in terms of work. How do you usually come into the office in a typical week.
P22: How do I come into the office? Like, yeah.
P22: how do I get to work? Yeah. Definitely, I commute to work, probably like a 15-20 min drive depending on traffic. So I do drive to work.
P22: Both locations are roughly around the same timeframe. 15 to 20 min for me. If I meet with the client, I typically like to schedule my own meetings with people, I don't like basing them off of other people's schedules. I like to be able to meet at a certain location that's convenient for both, not just myself or them. So I try to be flexible as much as I can, but also depending on my timeframe. I need to be able to be like, hey, let's meet here instead of here.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Great. And also, how often do you come to office in a typical week.
P22: Office is every single day of the week. The only times I work from home is more necessarily if, like family members are sick, or
P22: it's like
P22: I said, there's a contractor working at my house, so it's like it's an anomaly. I wouldn't say it's always. But there has been times already, I think 5 times where I've worked from home this year. So yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thanks for clarification.
P22: Yeah.
S: How long have you lived in Kern County or San Joaquin Valley?
P22: Yeah. So my whole life I was born and raised here. So that is 22 years going on to 23. So I'll be 23 this October.
S: Hmm, okay, wow!
S: How do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley?
P22: Air quality specifically in San Joaquin Valley, does that pertain to Bakersfield?
P22: Okay. So the air quality in Bakersfield, you could definitely tell the difference, especially because I enjoy camping. And I like going out to like where there's forest and different areas. And right away you could definitely feel the difference in air quality.
S: So it seems like your parent
S: move from other city or country or other community to Bakersfield. How do they talk about? Have you ever had a chance to talk about air quality with your parents?
P22: Not necessarily with my with my parents. I have spoke with colleagues regarding the air quality, because, you know, you could look up in the air, and you could definitely see the the difference between our sky and and the different location that isn't trapped in a bowl of mountains.
P22: My dad does work outside. He's a landscaper. He owns his own business landscaping.
P22: But I haven't had that conversation with him regarding air quality. No.
S: Okay? So you are. You were born and raised in Bakerfield and
S: have your perspective on air quality,
S: changed during that time for 20 years.
S: Change bad to good or good to bad, or it could be consistent.
P22: I would say it's consistent. I have, as I grow up, realized that air quality is a little worse in Bakersfield compared to other locations I haven't really looked into like the implications that could like hurt an individual that's being raised here compared to somewhere that they have a better air quality. But from my experience of traveling I've been to 12 different States, different National Forests, and you could definitely tell the difference in when you breathe, essentially.
S: Hmm!
S: So when we are young we don't much care about the air quality.
S: When I was young I I play basketball outside when there's a heavy dust from China. So
S: bad air came from China to South Korea.
S: But I didn't aware about that, because I was not educated at the time. But were there any moment you had experienced that you begin to think about the air quality is not good, and you need to avoid the day when the air quality is not good?
P22: Definitely. Yes, especially with my little one since he was born. I definitely think about, especially during like Kern County fair. That's a big one. When I was a kid growing up I would always go. I would never think about the air quality there.
P22: but it's a lot of dust, especially by the last days of the fair, definitely have have been something I have to talk to my spouse about, possibly not going to the fair anymore with our little one, because I don't want him being affected either through viruses or also just a common theme that I've noticed. A lot of people in Kern County have asthma problems. I myself depending on
P22: air quality. I wouldn't say air quality, but depending on the day is when I, when I notice it a little bit more.
S: So you mean your new baby?
P22: Yes.
S: Okay?
S: Right. I I moved to Bakersfield in 2022 with my 3 month old baby.
S: but I had to move to north part of the LA.
S: Near [area in LA]
S: because of the air quality. Yeah, I didn't realize that my family might affected by the air quality in Kern county, but
S: because of the symptom we are experiencing, my baby is experiencing. We had to make a decision.
P22: Yeah.
S: So I totally understand your experience.
S: So, okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I have quick questions compared to before you had children. Has your thinking or thoughts about the air quality changed in any significant way?
P22: I would say yes, for that one. Just being more proactive with my baby, and making sure that he's well, you know you yourself, you feel what you feel. But when you start thinking about, you know your little, your little one definitely start to think about those items as in likem, his health? Is it? Is it a very healthy place to be raised in those types of questions? Start to come up in your head with your child.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Definitely, children are more vulnerable. And I have one more question, has this changed,
Sung Hyoun Hong: Has this change influenced your behaviors.
Sung Hyoun Hong: or how you approach the air quality issues, or like any more, you know.
P22: Yeah, definitely, I would say, especially after Covid masks were more and more often, so say, for instance, we were to go to the Fair, and we know that there's going to be pretty bad air quality there because of the dust. Then we would most likely wear a mask, and my baby most likely will wear a child mask if there is one available, or something just to be more proactive with those types of situations of putting my child in those environments rather than not doing it and just deciding not to go overall. So I would say, it does have an impact
P22: on how I approach the the air quality. Now that I'm more aware of it, as I'm older.
S: Hmm.
P22: Helpful. Thank you.
S: Other than other than the experience that the air quality impact a certain, you know, participation
S: for the certain events.
S: do you have any experience that the air quality conditions like dust or ozone level, or, you know, heat
S: affect your daily activities.
P22: Is that more of an opinion based question or more advise if I I've already thought about that.
S: Yeah, your experience that you already had.
P22: Okay, I would say. I haven't really
P22: experienced anything yet in that sort of way, especially when it comes to like the sun and the ozone, and so I wouldn't be able to speak on that one.
S: Okay, thank you very much.
S: Has air quality ever affected your work, productivity, or attendance?
S: In my case, when there's a heavy dust,
S: I was willing to cancel the class. And you, you know, that will impact the productivity of my my teaching and also education quality of our student members.
P22: Yes, I think I think it does have an impact, especially with traffic. I feel that. You know, I would be a little bit more proactive and leave early knowing that there's heavy winds or heavy
P22: weather conditions. So I would want to avoid any traffic on the way.
S: Yeah. So with the weather app, do you frequently check the the wind speed, or or temperature or air quality?
P22: I would say yes, especially when you're going up the grapevine. I think it's very important just to be more more safe.
S: have you ever noticed some onion or garlic smell around grapevine, I smell a lot around grapevine.
P22: Okay, yes. Are like the the cattle smell?
S: Not cattle,
S: cattle smell, of course, but there's a smell around a grapevine like like a garlic or onion.
P22: Oh.
P22: Yes, yes, yes, I know exactly what you're talking about. Yes, the the there's farms
P22: like onion farms, garlic farms around the area, and I think that's what's making that.
S: Hmm!
S: So I wonder that is a smell of pesticide, not the organic plant or crops, but I just wanted to check with you.
P22: Yeah, I have. I know exactly what you're talking about. Yes.
Sung Hyoun Hong: From what I understand that you seems like you seem to enjoy camping and other outdoor activities. And just curious. Have you ever changed your plan or schedule because of the air quality.
P22: Air quality. Yes, especially if you know it's gonna be a windy day, and you can't really make a campfire at night. It is very
P22: you you kind of have to go based off of the weather when you go camping a lot of the times, especially if you're going on hikes, or if you're going to go out to the lake, you don't want to be going when you know air quality is a little bit worse, or there's going to be like a lot of wind, and you're not gonna be able to enjoy the day.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Regarding your work activities. Have you also had changed your work schedule, such as meeting your clients.
P22: Yes, I have, depending on on their time, my time, and also weather conditions. Say, it's raining. They're they're unable to make it due to traffic, or for whatever reason or air quality is just not good. I have had one customer before tell me that due to the air quality they they were wanting to switch the meeting that did happen once.
S: Was that because of the dust or air quality itself.
P22: Dust itself.
S: Okay. And I just wanted to talk about how you observe others. Others how they
S: deal with the air quality. Have you ever noticed
S: the air quality here impacted the others around you?
P22: Yes, I have seen individuals. When it's extra windy they do wear a face mask. I myself I try to as much as I can, but sometimes they could get annoying when you're wearing them, especially for long periods of times. But I do have friends and family members that I do know, do wear masks if it's an extra windy day, or if they work outside, for instance, like in the fields or in landscaping, I am aware of that.
S: Hmm.
S: Okay. But sometimes I I feel like am I? Am I the only one who wears a mask, even though I detected the air air quality is not good, so when I
S: take, find a mask from my car and went out. But nobody took the mask.
S: Have you ever.
P22: Right.
S: You know, felt about those kind of
S: feelings, or maybe kind of pressure that
S: you're the only one who wears a mask. So you're hesitant to wear the mask.
P22: I wouldn't say I've ever felt hesitant to wear a mask. I think sometimes the the belief with the mask is that you might be sick. So I know of people that do speak on that. But I don't think I've ever felt any type of way for wearing a mask specifically. If it's a bad air day, I'll definitely be wearing one. But if if it's for sick purposes also. But I do see. I have heard of people thinking that there's negative connotation
P22: with wearing a mask more attributed to being someone sick.
S: So. So there's kind of kind of culture or common understanding that if people wear masks, people might think that he or she is sick rather than they are, avoiding air quality around them.
P22: Correct from my experience of talking with people.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: is there any kind of culture pressure that people see someone who wear mask as a weak person, not as a sick person.
P22: I wouldn't say weak person. I do say more sick.
S: Hmm!
S: So like, you know, when people have a 1st meeting, maybe when you have a meeting with your client.
S: We never we. We hesitant to wear a mask when it is a first meeting.
S: because we need to be.
S: I feel like I need to provide a more positive, you know image, the personalized image.
P22: Do you think that that will also happen around you?
P22: I think so. Yeah, you want to be transparent with the first person in your meeting. You don't want them questioning why, you're wearing the mask. So I I would say that there, there could be those instances.
S: Okay, so being that we hesitant to wear masks.
S: maybe because of those kind of pressure, how about talking about the air quality concerns. How comfortable are people in your workplace or around you with discussing air quality issue.
P22: I would say comfortable. I think it's a known. It's a known issue here in Bakersfield with the air quality, and I think it is a subject of matter that most people talk about
P22: and it's more so like you talk about it. But you don't really do anything about it unfortunately. It's not nothing, really. We can do. We all live here. It's we all know Bakersfield's in the bowl we're at surrounded by mountains. So all our pollution, all typically Bakersfield air quality isn't the best.
S: Hmm!
S: When I talk with my colleagues in our campus I told him first that I fear about catching valley fever, but he told me that
S: he heard about that, but it never affected him, and
S: I don't feel like I will never catch the valley fever, and I, in that
S: moment. I felt, like, you know, awareness of air quality issues quite different across people.
P22: Yes.
S: Do you have similar experience like me?
P22: Yes, I've actually had a best friend that had the the virus.
S: Valley fever?
P22: Yes, and it was when she was younger. So now, whenever she goes out and it's pretty bad air quality, she
P22: she does wear a mask because it's it's better for her after beating. I don't. I don't know if you can beat Valley fever or not. I believe you can. But I do know that she suffers with that. So she would definitely wear masks anywhere she goes, especially the air quality is pretty bad. I would agree with you that some people are a little bit more lax about the air quality, some people aren't. I think it just depends per experience of each individual.
S: Hmm, okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I think. Yeah, sorry.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, I think this is kind of similar question, what? Sunjin has asked. During the covid period, when I talk about the concerns around Covid. Some some of my friends were very understanding, but others didn't really care like they're saying, that's just out there, why are you caring so much? And some people even questioned why I was bringing the fear into the conversation and the table. So do you think it's similar with
Sung Hyoun Hong: it is something similar to the air quality issue there. Like, when you talk about health health concerns related to the air quality at work, how do people typically react? Those comments.
P22: Yeah, they. They acknowledge the issue. I wouldn't say they react in like a hostile way or in a, you know, deflect the conversation type of way. I think it's more so, like we all understand that the air quality is pretty bad in Bakersfield, but we do with what we can.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, it is.
P22: But I do. I do. I do agree that less people are more proactive about it, and would rather not wear masks
P22: exactly
P22: negative connotation that it might be with wearing a mask and also addition with the you know, it's like a I wouldn't say a burden to wear a mask, but sometimes it's it's a little too much when you wear it for too long.
S: Hmm!
S: How do you think your coworkers would react if you regularly discussed discuss about air quality issue with them.
P22: In my fast paced working job. I don't think there's a lot of time for us to talk about that, because there is a lot of work to be done. So I would say it would be more so like one or two times bringing it up. But there's like, all right, man, come on. Why are you bringing this up so much? So I would say a little negative after a while, because of our intense workloads.
S: Alright. Yeah, it's up to the environment where we are working. I think in the in the workplace you're currently working on. I think it's not a
S: common theme.
P22: Correct.
S: You are talking, because there's only short time you can interact with your colleague.
P22: Correct. Yeah, it'll be more so like, just so.
P22: Conversation starter everybody over to go to lunch, or something like that. But in the day to day, honestly, it's just in the in the trenches of underwriting, asking the questions to the customers, getting the correct needs list, making sure your loan portfolio is up to status with every covenant that there is. So it's a very fast paced job.
S: Okay.
P22: Limited time.
S: And but when people talk about
S: talk about their kind of, you know concerns about air quality that the other person can also experience. People feel some sense of connection with the others.
S: because they realize that they are facing common challenges, such as dealing with poor air quality.
S: So when you learn that others share similar air quality issues, how does that affect you?
P22: You. You think about it a little bit more especially when it's brought up, because I think it air quality. It's a little bit more of a it's in the back of the mind of everybody in Bakersfield. They know the air quality isn't the best, but at the same time. It's like, we all know it's there, and it's not. It's not good for ourselves. But when the conversations do come up
P22: I would say that it's it brings that little bell inside your head was like, Okay, what can I do about this? What would I think? What measures can I make to make sure my child, or myself, or my family is safe?
S: Hmm!
S: Do you think that sharing your experiences with others about air quality could help you feel more connected to others in your organizations or community, or
S: it could be.
P22: I would say, Pop, potentially, yeah, like I said, it's a really good conversation starter something that everybody has to deal with in Bakersfield. So it's a good conversation starter.
S: So you think that those kind of concerns or issue, like, you know, hot weather or dust, a wind dust that could
S: be a catalyst to start a good conversation with them?
P22: It could. Yeah.
S: Do you have any specific examples or moments you felt the sense of connection?
P22: Sense of connection about talking about the air quality not off the top of my head. Now.
Sung Hyoun Hong: What about sense of connection after
Sung Hyoun Hong: having conversation? And you realize, you guys have kind of like common
Sung Hyoun Hong: concerns or experience common challenges or problems.
P22: I would say that there could be a connection in that, especially because it's similar items that each individual is going through.
S: Okay, one more. One more thought. I just wanted to hear about you.
S: So when we disclose our concerns with others, it could be our vulnerability.
S: like you know your concern can be. Air quality could impact your newborn child. But those kind of sharing could open up a you know, you know, kind of environment where you and your friends or colleagues can
S: share the other concerns like, you know, organizational issues or conflicts with others, so that you can
S: conversation to resolve those issues have you ever experienced when the
S: talk about the air quality issue or heat?
S: Led to the other discussion that could make some
S: sharing moment with your colleagues or your friends?
P22: Yes, now that you bring up the heat. Yes, that's always a common trait in Bakersfield. It's always hot in the summer, and there's always a running joke that oh, here's Bakersfield summer, the heat, because it's the heat's very, very intensive in the summertime. So yes, I would say there is that shared experience.
S: Hmm.
P22: Within the summer. Yeah.
S: Can you elaborate more about
S: those experiences? Are there any specific examples.
P22: Yeah. So, for instance, whenever customers come into the branch because there's the open branch, people could come in and you could overhear conversations with man. The summer heat's already here. You could already start feeling it, or man. It's time to go to the beach to enjoy a nice weather, instead of being in Bakersfield over the weekend? So those types of conversations are had at times, or even just start off the conversation like, Hey, what do you think about the weather? Our Bakersfield heat's finally here.
P22: Those are the types of conversations I guess you could say, are are had in a daily
P22: daily conversation, at times.
S: Okay, thank you very much. The reason why, you know, ask a more specific, you know, experiences that
S: in our research it will come out with a paper.
S: So we're gonna quote the part of your you know your statement.
P22: Okay.
S: No worries. If this paper came out I will definitely let you know, but all your information will be deleted. But.
P22: Yeah, no worries. Yeah, thank you for for for having me. I appreciate it
P22: definitely. Let no other other coworkers, other individuals that you know in the community know about the research. And that way you guys could set a schedule and and time hopefully hopefully brings over the 20 people that you need.
P22: I think research is always great. I think it's very, very well, especially when when you research topics that you don't really think about on daily
P22: or things that everybody knows in common, making sure this is the best air quality. It's always hot here as well. So it's a really good topic to to research on and see if there are any solutions. So I appreciate you guys doing that.
S: Thank you. There are a few more questions, and among them here's the one. Have you ever felt like your concerns might be dismissed as overreacting or being too sensitive to others.
P22: To others with the weather.
P22: Yeah, war weather, or, you know, air quality
P22: dismissed, I wouldn't say dismissed, but more like making a joke out of it. Yes.
P22: that's more related to my previous comment. Where with the weather? Oh, here's the Bakersfield weather, or
P22: or Oh, you're so you're so lucky you're inside. You're not working outside.
P22: Yes.
S: Okay?
S: And let's talk about your current organization's efforts. And
Sung Hyoun Hong: Before we moving forward. Can I ask one quick question?
P22: Yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So in the early interview you mentioned about your you're
Sung Hyoun Hong: difference of your thoughts based on the reason where you add in the Bakersfield. And do you see any
Sung Hyoun Hong: kind of differences across the month about in terms of their quality.
P22: Air quality. No, I can't speak on that. I don't. I don't see any major differences, but when it comes to like the actual weather. I do see differences. Obviously, summertimes are hotter winter times are colder so I wouldn't be able to speak on the the
P22: air quality.
Sung Hyoun Hong: What about the dust like? Is there any like? Are there any major
Sung Hyoun Hong: time when you experience severe dust problem or the air quality issues.
P22: With dust. Yes, related to dust. I have seen that there are some cyclical periods in the seasons where it could be a little bit more dusty, more dry, obviously the summertime. So it's a little bit more dry. So you see, more dust compared to the wintertime when it's raining, it kind of narrows out those dust particles.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Gotcha. And during times like that, do you notice, like people reacting differently? Or people talk about air quality issues more in the workplace.
P22: Yes, and then another. Another case I could bring up is also allergies. I've noticed that a lot of people are allergic in Bakersfield, and especially during like the springtime. That's when I feel my allergies kick in. And then for the rest of the year, during winter time, they kind of go away.
P22: and I see a common trait with that with other people as well.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Gotcha. Thank you.
S: So let's talk about future plan. And considering the air current air quality here.
S: Do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area for long term?
P22: It depends. It heavily depends on life. It depends on job opportunities. It also depends on major
P22: environmental issues. I would say as well, I think, for the majority of my twenties and thirties, I will be working in Bakersfield. That's just where the point in time in life. I am right now. Eventually, once I become executive, I would hope to be able to work from anywhere I want, and potentially be
P22: and other better environments where it's a lot cooler, a lot more foresty, that's my, that's my goal. That's my dream. Hopefully, you know. Have a few investment properties here in Bakersfield and be able to live somewhere else and have somebody else manage that for me and work from remotely. That would be my goal.
S: Okay. So I understood that that their air quality itself does not impact your long-term plans.
S: It's more about your career or job opportunity.
P22: Yeah, I would say so.
S: Okay.
P22: Yeah. Because, unfortunately, you know, I reside and make sure that work in Bakersfield Church go to church. Everything's here is in Bakersfield for me. So it'd be really hard for me just because of air quality. Say, Hey, it's time for us to pack up and move. There's so many variables that I would need to double check Joanna's work. My work, my child's school. It's kind of like
P22: everything's here, so it'd be hard to move all at once.
S: I also attend church, and church is really important, because they are more like our family.
P22: Yes.
S: What changes would make you feel more optimistic about living and working here in Kern County for long term.
P22: In terms of living and working in Kern County. I think as long as there's air conditioning in the building, I think it's all good for me, unfortunately, like I said, everything's here in Bakersfield. I can't really make a big switch.
S: You're right.
P22: Let's say, get up and go and let's go move over here. It'd be very difficult to say, hey, it's time to move. Now, if there's a major environmental issue, and you know it's affecting everything at 10 times full, then yes, it could definitely be something where, like we need to the the benefit of the cost. Is it? Is it worth staying here and affecting our health a lot more? Or is it more beneficial just to say, Hey, let's get up and go somewhere else.
S: Hmm, okay, thank you very much. And one more. One last question.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Actually, I think we have missed some of our question regarding your company. So I do have couple of questions regarding your organization. So what steps has your organization taken to address your air? The air quality issues in San Joaquin Valley, and I think your company already provide a good level of flexibility in terms of work schedule so other than that do they?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Are they making any efforts, such as distributing like mask or kind of providing information about the air, quality, or weather, or using provided air purifiers in the office.
P22: Air purifiers. Yes, mask are available. The only one that I don't
P22: see is probably the talk of it, or things that they're implemented to improve. Aside from mask and air purifiers.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Other than that? Do they provide anything useful to deal with air quality issues? Or do they make any kind of significant effort to improve the air quality issues in your area.
P22: Not that I'm aware of. No.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Then my last question will be, what kind of support or initiative do you think your organization could provide to better address air quality concerns of your employees.
P22: I think, currently right now, with air purifiers and offering masks. I think that's sufficient in terms of trying to fix it. That's like a whole county issue at that point city issue that would be out of their control.
P22: But they could provide funding. So bank banks provide funding so it could be something they could look into.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thank you for sharing.
P22: Yep.
S: And my one last question is, I just wanted to
S: have your feedback on what direction this? My, our research can go. So we wanted to find that
S: how air quality in Kern County could impact
S: to form a unique culture in Kern County. So I feel like, you know, people here they really watch each other and help each other, and
S: the sense of community is quite strong compared to other community, especially when I talk with people in La, since there are too many people, too various type of people in LA. I feel like they don't, you know.
S: bind each other. But in Kern county, no matter which ethnic group they belong to, I feel like they have common understanding of their community.
S: So have you, do you have any suggestion? What kind of
S: questions or direction that we can have for our following participants.
P22: I think I think what you guys are doing is amazing. I think it's great to talk about the air quality and the issues that there are here in Bakersfield.
P22: If it's at a larger scale definitely, it's well as well. Now, in terms of being more connected and make a shield. I think the major difference is the population of individuals. I think the the smaller populations are, the more they are prone to hang out, more prone they are to, you know, conversate in a day-to-day life as cities get bigger. I think it does become a problem where you know, everybody has different ideologies. Everybody has
P22: different opinions, and it's a little bit harder to make meet. Certain people talk to certain people. I think, in more close communities they do have that control of being able to help each other, being able to be more close together. But I do see what you say about LA. At times, you know, you're driving down the car. Someone just swipes you, or they're a little bit more aggressive. I do see those common trends.
P22: In terms of questions. I don't know any off the top of my head that could assist. But if I definitely do have some.
P22: I'll definitely email them.
S: Okay, thank you very much. It was really helpful. And we will also ask ideas from Joanna definitely. Men and women have different thought about the air, quality
S: and awareness. So we are also investigating the gender differences as well.
P22: Oh, that's good!
S: Yeah, so thank or volunteering.
P22: Yeah, personally, I think men are a little less more like concerned about it. I think females are a little bit more concerned just off of my own opinion. So yeah, I definitely appreciate you guys doing the different. The differences in that.
S: Okay, thank you very much. So we will bring the same questions. To the people you introduce. So it would be great if you can introduce and
S: I will send you the Amazon gift card right away. And also I'll provide a small picture that you know, recruiting the interview. Okay, thank you very much, P22.
P22: Thank you. Thank you, Professor. You guys have a great rest of your day.
S: Good one. Yeah, thank you.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thank you.
