P13: The region is very, you know, high levels and open for air pollutions. So I will say that the air quality is it very. It varies around the district because it's depending on the temperature, sure whether it's in the winter or.
K: Benjamin.
P13: Generally impossible.
K: I'm sorry your voice was breaking. Can you repeat what you said? I'm sorry about that.
P13: Alright. I say that the air quality I can't really say about the air quality, because it's perpetual and varies basically with the weather. So here in the Saint John Green Valley, it's very essential to wash out the air quality
P13: on, on with temperature. So for how, for the time I've been here. The quality have been very positive, but with times it it ranges down the negative levels so I wouldn't like to conclude it negatively. But I would just say that it's good.

P13: Having a negative health impacts and
P13: and may cause some allergies due to some cardiovascular concerns. To this I'm unable to complete my daily activities or some working tasks. So it affects my my working activities.

P13: and air pollution arts. So I to create a very indoor environment, using air purifiers in my home just to maintain a clean home to reduce the indoor air pollution. These are, I'm very much concerned about my family.

P13: and also family activities has been limited because our families and our workplace we could no longer plan on picnics. We could no longer plan on visiting spot or doing sport, you know. You just have to. You just have the the organization to change our or change an alternative that may require fully time, indoor activities or in indoor tasks.
K: Yeah, okay, so how do you feel when others share similar experiences related to air pollution?
P13: Alright like I said, you are experiencing, because I really think that should be soon, because we just driving our our towards this the the weather. So I would just have everybody to check their air quality indexes, because.
P13: every activities you should plan or every activity you want to plan should basically be on the A quality forecast.
P13: You should not be ignorant of the air quality index. So to these, everyone around should wear protective gear
P13: use of masks respirators, and also stay hydrated like
P13: drinking a lot of water can keep the body to cope with the poa pollution around the area and to avoid any stressful activities or attacks that will make you dehydrated
P13: to this. I'll I'll just suggest every home install their a purifier because it can help to. You know, environments and purifies the air.

P13: All right. If someone, anybody, especially my colleagues, should share.
K: Yeah.
P13: About the poor equality in the area. How we just have to, you know. Tell them to stay informed about their indexes, because we are having a sense of community and a sense of belonging without being biased. I just have to
P13: recommend. I recommend the partner or my colleague to, you know, install some several preventive measures that can help to mitigate the poor air quality.
P13: I don't have to discourage the person, but I just have to tell him to work more productively, and increasing absenteeism, to to just flush away the negative impact of the air for equality.
K: Right so.
K: How has this sense of bond affected your thoughts, feelings, or actions toward your organizations?
P13: All right. The actions. And is a version community here?
P13: because we were having a discussion about the poor air quality.
P13: It's a time to promote a clean energy among among our colleagues. So to these several topics, like a proper renewable energy system, like solar and wind power, may be discussed during our our personal discussion. So to these, we hope to have a very positive discussion that may helps to develop the community.
P13: and, you know, make a suggestion to the government to limit how
P13: to limit or to encourage sustainable transportation, you know, to Diesel, we can. We can work on public transportation, because basically, they contribute to the integral part of the airport. Poor air pollution pollution. Here
P13: the corresponding of Forsyth, where some company around the valley are using some some some technologies that emits
P13: emits, some, some some impurities to the air.
K: Okay.

P13: Yeah, just what I finish during this period when you're discussing about the air quality, you are able to promote a clean energy
P13: and make some suggestions to the Government.

P13: All right.
P13: This is limited to my arsehole, because I've not made any attempt to, you know, to the public.
P13: So in my home. I make sure that all my children, my belongings, they have access to face marks, and I install a purifier in my restroom, my kitchen.
P13: and in my dining. So that's the action I've made. And we steer away from stranger activity and outdoor activities.

P13: materials that helps. And also we are working on a shift. We're working on shifts. We're no longer working on on 30 h plus a week or a month. So we're working on a shift.
P13: hey?
K: So what do you think about that? The actions that they're taking.
P13: That's the action. The organization has been able to schedule their talks to workers and proper shifting, so we can work highest 2 to 3 times a week.
P13: so we can fully concentrate on our homes.
K: Yeah, okay, so has support from your organization, changed your perspective on air quality issues?
P13: No, not at all.

P13: It will bring more connection amongst the peers, you know. At least, if it's a company that the Government wants to bring, I think it will open a means of employing the youths around in the community to work
P13: either as our soul or as a employee to stabilize equality.
K: So what potential factors can make? People leave the San Joaquin valley, what do you think are?
