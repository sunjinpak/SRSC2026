# Interview 40

## Transcript
 
[Participant #40]: Yeah. So I work at Csub in University advancement. I am the senior event specialist for advancement and also the President's office. So my team and I. We plan events, for on behalf of advancement, for so, like donor events, fundraising events. 
we do fundraising events for athletics and alumni, and then also just kind of general events for the President's office meetings, celebrations, ceremonies, stuff like that.
 
S: Okay. I think me and my my students and I had also invited to the President's associates events.
 
[Participant #40]: Yes, yes. So I actually, I helped plan that that.
 
S: Okay, I saw a beautiful posture. It's a really huge and I really like that post because it includes my face. And also, my, you know my suited.
Kept it in my room. Is that the poster you are creating.
 
[Participant #40]: No? Well, kind of, we're part of the. So the program itself, like the student research scholars on that is run by another part of advancement in conjunction with, like the Scholarship office.
So the actual like programming side of it. We don't have that much to do with it. But then, like the actual events like the meet and greet and the recept recognition dinner, my team. We plan that so. Imitations, design. All the decorations, all that stuff, food.
 
S: Okay. Does your work? Have some flexibility to work indoors or outdoors.
 
[Participant #40]: Yes, so well, some. So we're in Bakersfield. So we don't have that many outdoor events, especially like this time of the year. And so if we have an event outside. Yes, I have to be outside to service that event but we don't have too many outdoor events speaking about like President's associate that's outside every year.
 
S: What if the day when we have an event like President's associates? It has a heavy win, and it picks up lots of dust are. Does your team consider to reschedule that event?
 
[Participant #40]: Yes, so weather is, you know, an important part of event planning. So it have to be pretty windy for that to happen. But it has. We've had events before where we were supposed to have actually, as an example, we do an international students lunch for international students on behalf of the President that's usually always outside outside the President's office.
Last year it was super super windy, so windy that it knocked down a tree. Actually. So we moved it inside, and we held it in the December reading room. So not necessarily because of the wind, but because it could have been a hazard.
 
S: Okay, because it could hurt people physically, right?
 
[Participant #40]: Yes, and because, you know, we have stuff on the tables, decor and so I don't want to get blown away.
 
S: Okay, can you walk us through a typical day, including your working hours, and after your work.
 
[Participant #40]: Sure. So my normal hours during the year or 8 to 5 during the summer it's 7 to 6 but we are a little bit more flexible on that, and we're allowed to work from home if we need to, or want to. So generally in the office that whole time.  meaning like at work, but not necessarily always in the office. If we have different areas, we're doing site reviews for different events need to move around campus and take care of those things. Go to event spaces things like that. So big part of my day is, you know answering emails and planning events things like that from my computer. But some of it is out and about on site and around campus.
 
S: Okay. How long have you lived in Bakersfield?
 
[Participant #40]: 8 years.
 
S: 8 years. And what brought you here.
 
[Participant #40]: My husband is a professor in biology. So he was offered a position here, and then I actually also got hired at csub. So we're here for work.
 
S: That's wonderful. Well, my wife also worked at Csv. As a lecture, appointed as a assistant professor here.
 
S: So it's really good to have both jobs in the same organization.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, yeah, it's great, you know, we carpool. And we live pretty close to the school, too. So it's really convenient. It's great.
 
S: How do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley?
 
[Participant #40]: Not great, not good. So I don't think about it too much day to day, but when I do think about it, I'm not pleased with it. We try to manage our own environment in our home as much as we can. We have air purifiers and things like that. I'm also predominantly an indoor cat. So I I'm not like spending hours and hours outside hiking and going around so it doesn't affect me all that much, but I have noticed some effects in the last, like 8 years since moving here.
 
S: So compared to the place before you came to Bakersfield. Can you compare the air quality.
 
[Participant #40]: I can. Yeah. So we lived in Minneapolis for 2 years before we moved here. And it is a city, but it's very.
There's a lot of opportunities to get out of the city and into like the fresh air and the fresh air. There is very nice, so I would say, the air quality here is much worse than where I came from.
 
S: Did you and your husband realize that the air quality here is this bad?
 
[Participant #40]: No, I guess like that's not even something that I really thought about. So we're from the Midwest. I get that. It's like a really big thing out here that people talk about a lot. But even like growing up, I never heard anybody really talk about the air quality, even though I'm from a place, as you know, manufacturing stuff, I probably should have learned about it. But, I never really even encountered it as an issue until we moved here. So it wasn't really something I took into account when we were deciding when where to move.
 
S: Hmm, okay, dr. Lee and I also have our Phd. Degree at illinois champaign.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, that's where I went.
 
S: Oh, really.
 
[Participant #40]: Yeah, I'm from Illinois. Yeah.
 
S: Okay? Oh, wow. So we we both thought that, you know, air quality issue is not the thing we need to concern in United States. But once we move to California, you know it's hot and the ozone level is quite high during the day, and there's a valley fever here.
Thought that those kind of issues there's a concern from the developing country, not in the United States, but now.
 
[Participant #40]: I never had heard. I mean, I guess I had like vaguely heard about it. But like it wasn't something I really thought about. But yeah, my husband and I met at University of Illinois. That's where we met.
That's fine. Yeah. So maybe we were like.
 
H: What do you? What do you guys, Major in.
 
[Participant #40]: I was an English major. And my husband. He studied biology. So he's a biology professor now.
 
H: What a cool coincidence! Okay.
 
[Participant #40]: I know is that crazy? Yeah.
 
S: I really like the Biology Building. It's a really fancy one.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, yeah, super nice. I think.
 
S: It was newer when we moved there. So yeah, they have a great, it's a beautiful campus.
 
S: Yeah. Hoon's wife also graduated from Illinois, and my wife also graduated from Illinois.
 
[Participant #40]: So I did 2 years at Illinois. I wish I could say I graduated. I did not. I did 2 years there and then my husband finished. So he's older than me. He finished his undergrad and then was going to Michigan State for his Phd. So I moved, and I finished my last 2 years at Michigan, State.
 
S: Okay, oh dear!
 
H: When I was a little kid. So I mean.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, yeah.
 
S: Oh, do you know that Doctor Che in our department? He got his Phd. Degree at Michigan State.
 
[Participant #40]: So yeah, that's where my husband got his Phd. And then we were in Minneapolis.
 
S: For his postal. Okay? Oh, what a coincidence! Yeah.
 
[Participant #40]: I know we're midwestern. We're very from the Midwest. So this is the furthest we've ever lived from. We've been in Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa that whole area. But.
 
S: So for 8 years in Bakersfield, had your perspective on air quality has been changed during that time.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, I think for sure for sure. Cause like I said, it's not ever something I even thought about like you'd see it on your weather app or something it was like, but it was never something where, like, you know, I lived in Chicago, and like bigger cities, too, where I think maybe people do think about that more. But even so, I wasn't really thinking about it so definitely, though, since we moved here, I've also seen
So I grew up having exercise induced asthma, and I sort of just grew out of it. But it has come back actually, in the last couple of years, so I wouldn't say like I could definitely blame it on the air quality, but I don't think that it has helped my breathing.jkmm
 
S: So it seems like, Participant #40, your views on air quality has been evolved over time, especially since you know, 8 years ago you moved to Bakersfield. But were there any specific moment or event or conversation with your colleague that really caused your change in your thought of air, quality.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, I wish I could think of something specific. Can't think of anything specific. But I did notice, you know, that it was more just like a topic of conversation. You know, people would make a comment in the office about how the air quality was bad that day. I didn't even really have a frame of reference. For, like what? What does that even mean? So kind of just picking up on the general consensus around that it is an issue sort of made me realize that I should pay more attention to it. But naturally it's not something I necessarily would have thought about.
 
S: Okay, good. In what ways air quality in Bakersfield affect your daily activities.
 
[Participant #40]: Okay? So I would definitely say, the asthma thing was not good. So that's not my favorite thing that's happened.
I mean, I'm not again, not like a super outdoorsy person. So it's not like it's like keeping me from going on long hikes or anything. But I do also think it doesn't encourage me to get outside any more than I would have and especially like we have a swimming pool. I try to not really spend more than an hour or 2 out in the pool. Just because the sun there's like too much sun exposure. The air is not good. It just doesn't feel supportive to be outside. I understand.
 
S: So other than you know, reducing your exposure to the outdoor. You know the air. What actions have you taken to deal with the challenges of air, quality.
 
[Participant #40]: Yeah. So my husband and I both have allergies. So we are on medication for allergies. That helps a little bit with dealing with the air, and then we also do have high powered air purifiers, both in our main living space and in our bedroom.
 
S: Okay, have you noticed that the air quality also impacted others around you?
 
[Participant #40]: Not that I really notice. I mean, I hear a lot of people like, I know this is air quality, but I hear a lot of people talking about like how allergies and things are affecting them. And that's kind of. I guess maybe related. But it yeah, I haven't really noticed it affecting anybody else. Besides, when I've told a couple of people about my asthma coming back or getting worse, they've said, oh, like the same thing happened to me, or happened to somebody that I know.
 
S: Okay, it seems like you are sharing your symptoms or air quality concerns with. Your colleagues. How comfortable are people in your workplace in your team with discussing air quality issues or concerns.
 
[Participant #40]: So my office in general, and the whole division of advancement. We're very casual and very teamwork oriented. So we don't really have any issues talking about anything that's going on. So we don't keep it strictly professional. So yeah, any of us in the office, if we were having an issue with it, or, you know, wanted to chat about it would definitely bring it up.
 
S: Hmm, have your colleagues ever shared their personal or family concerns related to air quality issues with you.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, not that I can think of specifically.
 
S: Oh, that's totally okay. Okay, have you, have you ever wanted to wear mask, but felt hesitant, due to social you know, pressure.
 
[Participant #40]: Yes, sort of so actually, my! I grew up. My grandpa had a heart condition, so he wore a mask during especially the winter months, like all through the winter months. So it was normalized for me, like as people who have health conditions to wear a mask. Only, you know, during the pandemic when it became, you know, politicized, that I realize, you know, that some people have a different opinion of it. I believe in protecting yourself first, st and doing what's best for yourself. So, even though I know that sometimes when I wear a mask and might get a look or a comment from somebody I will still wear anyway. So yes, I've thought about it, as they put it on about what people will say, or you know what people have said to me, but I don't let that keep me from doing it.
S: Sometimes people feel a sense of connection with others when they face common challenges, like, you know, dealing with the poor air quality or valley fever. I think that happens in Bakersfield when you learn that others share similar, you know concerns about air quality issues. How do you feel about that?
 
[Participant #40]: I mean, I think it's in one way like you said. You know it does bring, you know, it's a common issue. So you know it makes you feel less alone when you're dealing with those type of things which is good. But it's also sad to know that it's affecting so many people so greatly, and it's also a reminder, you know. of my privilege that I can stay inside, or when I go outside, wear a mask, or take breaks or do whatever I need to do, and a reminder that there are people in our area that don't have that freedom and have to spend full long days out breathing in the air. So if anything, it's kind of sad when I hear about it. But yeah, I guess a way that a shared challenge can bring people together, I guess.
 
S: Do you feel so? I feel like you also feel grateful for your for the resources you can enjoy in order to overcome the air quality issues. But not all people have those kind of resources. So do you feel thankful or grateful for your current condition.
 
[Participant #40]: I guess. Yeah, yeah, it is. I mean, reflecting on my privilege. And you know it is nice that I have the means to improve my situation as much as I can. You know I still live here. There's only so much I can do. Go outside, just like everybody else.
 
S: Have you ever felt isolated, due to the environmental health concerns.
 
[Participant #40]: No.
 
S: Okay, were there any specific moments when you felt alone with these concerns.
 
[Participant #40]: No, I think that's 1 thing, though I feel like it is like a shared
 
[Participant #40]: I made me feel like I take it a little bit more seriously than some people, but I've never felt isolated because of it.
S: So you said, there are some some moment. You feel like you are more sensitive than others regarding air quality issue. So what kind of
 Have you ever felt like your concerns about air quality issues might be dismissed as overreacting or being sensitive.
 
[Participant #40]: Yes, I give actually, I understand that to be the case quite a bit. So I have an autoimmune disease. I have rheumatoid arthritis. So, even though I look completely healthy and normal, I do have some limitations to mobility and things like that. So I've kind of always like, have that little chip on my shoulder, of like people seeing me acting, or a certain way, or doing a certain thing, and thinking that oh, she's normal and healthy. She's doing that for attention or something like that. So I think there is. You know.
my mindset is kind of always going there, whether people really think that or not, it's hard to say, or if we're just projecting. But definitely, you know, I also have to be really careful about contracting diseases, because I take, you know, immune suppressing medication. So like, if it is really windy outside, and I'm having to walk between buildings at work like I will put on a mask. Everybody does that. And so there are probably a percentage of people who see that and think that it's an overreaction. But it's really me understanding. You know, my limitations.
 
S: Okay, regarding your experience, your symptoms, and that could also impact it by the air quality issues.
Did you share about those kind of difficulties with your colleagues.
 
[Participant #40]: I'm yeah. I'm very. I try to be very transparent. I honestly don't let these type of things stop me from doing anything but I do let them know if I need. You know, any kind of modification, or anything like that doesn't happen very often. But like I said. Our office is very casual, very close, so it's never taboo to just say your feelings, or, you know, ask for help. Anything like that.
 
S: Yeah, I'm interviewing several team members in your office, and I feel like I would like to change my.
 
[Participant #40]: I know not as a purpose for fun.
 
S: As a staff member in your department.
 
[Participant #40]: Yeah. So like, if I were having. I even feel like, if I were having a day where the air quality is really bad. And for some reason my asthma was bad, and I didn't want to go outside that I could say that and have that be accommodated. And people are pretty.
 
S: Yeah, I'm quite curious. What would it feel like to have a colleague to truly understand your health concerns?
 
[Participant #40]: It feels good. I mean, I can completely understand my health concerns. But having people it's more of like a trust thing like people trust you enough to know that what you're saying is right, like you're not trying to pull one over on people. So it it feels good to be supported and trusted. More than it has anything to do with being sick or needing special attention.
 
S: Those those transparent relationship. And having colleagues who could understand my situation. Does that help your team's work? Productivity.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, for sure. Absolutely because, I think, you know, like a say, a situation where one of us, maybe not even me, when you know, having a a day where they couldn't go outside, but we had stuff to do outside. We're accommodating enough and respectful enough of each other that the rest of the team would pick up the slack instead of having that person work outside of their comfort zone and possibly cause more problems.
 
S: actually, the your experiences you just shared is quite aligned with our core, you know, object of our research. So this research topic is about how people deal with the air quality issue. But it's more toward how toward looking at the difference between the between the person, how their sensitivity to the air quality is different.
And if there's a difference in the sensitivity in some organization, they understand each other, but in some organization they don't understand each other, and actually that disrupts their team. You know chemistry. So I think your team is on the the exemplar side.
from some very few interview. They don't want to disclose their health difficulties because one of their teammates or managers would use that to penalize them and hurt their career success.But actually, you are doing the opposite thing. You are transparent. What is the secret recipe to having those kind of great team culture? Can you recommend us how we can create those kind of team culture.
 
[Participant #40]: I would say that it starts from the top. So our division leader, Heath, is wonderful and very supportive of all of us I've never felt, and I don't think that other people in office have ever felt like you couldn't go to him and ask him a question or tell him something, and so I think there's a safety from the highest level. That kind of trickles down, you know, if
we can all expect Heath to support and understand us, then wouldn't it make sense that we could all support and understand each other? So I think, having good leadership is super important and people feel uncomfortable, so I kind of always am who I am, and a little bit loudly, and that works out great in some offices, but not everywhere.but the culture in our office is that everybody does have that room to be themselves and receive understanding from other people. So I think it is. Yeah, it starts at the top, and then everybody has to actively engage coming into every situation, giving the respect you'd hope to receive. I don't think there's anybody in our division that I couldn't go to and ask for help or and I wouldn't deny any other person help if they came to me. So yeah, I think it's just, you know, kind of silly Golden Rule stuff. Treat others how you want to be treated. Follow the example of the leaders and realizing that we're all really working toward a common goal. So there's no room in there for us to be adversarial with each other. It's just a waste of time.
H: As a follow up question. Sorry? Yeah. Forgive me. But did you say that you were the director or the or I'm sorry.
 
[Participant #40]: I'm senior specialists. So there's 3 people on my specific team. So there's a director, and then me. And then we have a coordinator, and we're part of the larger University Advancement Division, which has different offices like development does fundraising alumni relations plan giving that sort of thing.
 
H: Oh, cool. Okay. So as for your team, your specific 3, I mean what it I mean, what in what ways does your director help you help create that environment as well. I mean.
 
[Participant #40]: That's great. Yeah. So she also I would say, if you asked her, she would say, it comes from the top down, so he's supporting her helps it be easier for her to support us. But I will also say that I have a close personal relationship with her as friends. So that helps, because, you know, we have known each other now for 8 years, and, you know, have spent time together outside of work. So there is just like a comfortability there that we're okay sharing things with each other. So. And I will say that she does also. she's pretty direct in the way that she speaks to people, and I think she makes it clear that she was, you know, would like to receive the same. So I think people are open to sharing their feelings with her, just as she might share her feelings with them.
 
H: Okay? So does she provide? And what to what extent does she provide flexibility in your job? Then, I mean, in terms of work schedule, you know. Autonomy, all these stuff right?
 
[Participant #40]: Tons of flexibility. So that's another thing I would say. Starts at the top. Heath, trusts us all to get our work done. However, that looks to us, and it's not necessarily about.
you know I'm at my house right now, working instead of at the office, you know. It's not about necessarily being physically in the office, but being available and being productive. So definitely, he makes it okay. And then her, as my direct report, very, very flexible. So she understands she has kids. I don't have kids, but you know she has kids. So they take her away. Things like that. She gets what it's like to have other obligations really respects work, life balance. I know she takes that very seriously, so that allows us to do the same.
 
H: Okay, thanks for sharing.
 
S: Okay, do you think that your team or our organization provide any support or any practices to deal with the air quality issues?
 
[Participant #40]: Not that I have really seen to be honest with you.
I know that they provide some of the facilities people with, you know face masks and things like that which I think is great. But I also know that they don't require anybody to wear anything like that ever. So I think a policy in place, maybe for safety, like what on? But see, it's hard to quantify like on. If a day is X windy, then everybody should wear a mask like it's hard to say that, but some kind of way to encourage that to keep those people who don't have the full flexibility of being inside or working from home for the day. Something that could, you know, protect them, even extra breaks to bring them indoors would be, I think, appreciated.
 
S: What are your general thought about? You know Csuv's or your team's inactions regarding air quality. I guess I've never really thought about it, but I would. My the inaction on my team is not that serious to me? Because we do have so much autonomy and like personal responsibility that if I take it seriously and it's serious to me, I can make it serious. I do worry more about people in other departments who don't have that flexibility. So I would like to see more action on the part of the University to help those people, or at least encourage education of like knowing when it's important to wear a mask. You know, to protect against valley fever and all that stuff.
 
S: Yeah, I think we begin to talk about Valley Fever, University wide. So I found that we are distributing newsletter regarding valley fever.
But I think that's quite new. I think before, we haven't talked about it we only talk about the temperature. So I think we might extend our focus to the people who's very really sensitive to the air quality issues, who has asthma and who had, you know, experienced belly fever before, because they are really vulnerable people.
Okay, so let's talk about your long-term plans. So I know you are planning your career success with your husband. But considering the current air quality issues, do you see yourself continuing to live and work and Bakersfield for long term?
 
[Participant #40]: That's the plan, for now I mean, we own a house here, and we've been here for quite some time. My husband has tenured now, so he has a permanent position. My position has been permanent since the 1st year that I was here. So we do have the security here that we appreciate that being said like, you know, we're from somewhere else that's far away. So there's always part of us that, you know, is not. We're not tied to Bakersfield in the way that some other people are with familial ties or generational things like that. So there is always the possibility that we could go somewhere else.
LA Or Chicago, or back home, but for right now we're we're pretty firm on Baker's.
 
S: Okay, what factors most influence your decisions about staying in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #40]: That's a great question. Well, part of it, I would say, is like, you know, we're already here. So we moved around, you know as an academic earlier in my husband's career. We moved around quite a bit. And it was a lot of work. So there is something nice about just being planted, even if it's just us planted here, and not with other people around, that, you know, from our family, so that, I would say is great. The cost of living keeps us here for sure. We're not from California, but we've really fallen in love with California, especially love Los Angeles, and with the salaries that we make, we're able to have a much nicer life here in Bakersfield, spending our free time in Los Angeles than working and living in Los Angeles full time.
 So guess economic factors. Probably more than anything but also, you know, we've been here for 8 years. So we have friends and a network here. Now we're not blood family. But you know, activities that we're a part of. I teach Pilates studio near here. So we have lots of other things tying us to the community that we've been kind of leaning into for those 8 years.
 
S: it's a similar question. But it's different. I just wanted to give. So what changes would make you feel more optimistic about living and working in Bakersfield for long term.
 
[Participant #40]: Just about the air quality, or just generally.
 
S: Just general.
 
[Participant #40]: Oh, okay, hmm. This is not necessarily something that's easy to fix. But I just feel like the culture here is pretty like splintered, you know. That downtown is not, you know, like it is some other places like a hub where, like you feel like you can go. There's always activities going on and things like that. It's just a little bit sleepy for me. So like maybe more stuff going on would be great. The hard thing is, though, like we like to go to concerts, and most every concert comes to La, so they're not also coming to Bakersfield. So we're usually going to la for stuff like that. More activities here for younger people would be great. But that's about it. Everything else. This is actually like the area is more or less pretty similar to the area I grew up in. In rural Illinois is weird. Because it's so far away, but like the vibes are very similar. So, yeah, a little more cosmopolitan would be nice. But that's not really something you can do overnight.
 
S: It takes time.
 
[Participant #40]: Yeah, I think.
 
S: But still we have hope, because the population here is growing compared to other cities.
 
[Participant #40]: And you know I do. You know I have. My friends will come down and see us in Bakersfield, and we can have a pool day and things like that. So it is a nice pace of life. So yeah, not a lot of huge complaints about Bakersfield. Maybe like not my number one place I would want to live, but I'm not like rushing to move away.
 
S: Hmm, okay.
 
S: Last question is, do you have any recommending questions that I can give to the future interviewees?
 
[Participant #40]: No! I think you guys did a really good job.
 
S: Okay, thank you very much. It was nice nice to talking with you, and we found lots of, you know, valuable perspective, unique perspective from you. So I really appreciate that.
Thank you so much for your time. This is really fun.
 
H: Thank you so much. It was great meeting another, 
 
[Participant #40]: Have a great day.
 
S: Okay. Yeah.
 
[Participant #40]: See you around campus bye.
