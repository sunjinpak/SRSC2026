# Interview 36

## Transcript
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, I am currently an accounts payable supervisor. So I work in the finance department in my office.
 
S: Okay. Does that require your physical presence to the you know office.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes.
 
S: How's how flexible, how flexible! of your work.
 
[Participant #36]: So like to work from home. So during Covid we did have the ability to pretty much work the entire time at home. We only had the exception, since we did have to cut physical checks at our facility. We had to at least go 3 times a month to cut checks, physical checks, but since then they have implemented more technology. So now we use like a 3rd party that cuts checks for us as well. So that kind of helps that if we do need to like, not be present, like in case of an emergency. We can do everything from home and but the environment at home, I mean at work. If you have to work from home, you you kind of have the possibility to do it.
 
S: Hmm, okay, thank you. How long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley?
 
[Participant #36]: So. I am originally from La Los Angeles, and I have in Bakerfield, in Kern County. I have since 2,006, almost 20 years.
 
S: So what brought you here in Bakersfield from LA.
 
[Participant #36]: So originally the housing market was a lot more affordable than Los Angeles. So that's kind of how we ended up being in Current county.
 
S: The house price in Bakersfield is really high nowadays.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, now, yes, but I mean, compared to Los Angeles, is still a little bit more affordable.
 
S: Okay, how do you feel about air quality here.
 
[Participant #36]: I personally take my precautions, because in the valley we have the valley fever. It's very frequently that I hear people have had it. People that are close by, and so every time when it gets windy we make sure that we take our precautions, and we are, we try not to be outside at all. If it's going to be windy because of the air quality.
 
S: Okay. So mostly, you're concerned with valley fever.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes.
 
S: How about, you know ozone level or any chemical? You know, chemicals in the air.
 
[Participant #36]: So something personal about, and that affects my perspective is that I have a 3 year old, and he was diagnosed with autism. And since it's not something that's very common in my family. I do tend to believe that our environment has a little factor into it. So I do believe that we do have a lot of pollution chemicals nearby. Currently, I am in the process of buying a house, but because of it is pricing and everything. We are looking at everything like near something we are going to be near is within like a 2 mile radius of the wastewater facility. Kind of it's concerning, but I mean, you kind of have to pick and choose your battles.
 
S: But you could have affordable house and the house in other area.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes.
 
S: So you lived in San Joaquin Valley. I meanm Bakersfield for 20 years.
 
[Participant #36]: Sure.
 
S: Perspective on the air quality change during those 2 decades.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, so at the beginning we weren't very aware of, you know. things going around us, and with the continuous growth of the city we have seen. Well, we've met more people. We have seen more people being affected with the valley fever affected with just different things caused by like the environment asthma. My mom has asthma. So in comparison, like when we lived in La to when we actually moved to Bakersville, she actually has had to have treatments because of the air quality as well. So that's something that we did notice.
 
S: So you moved with your family, not only for yourself.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, with the full family.
 
S: So regarding the health symptoms or issues.
How many of the people has been affected by the you know the air quality in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #36]: So from our close friends and family members we have had at least 3 people that have had valley fever, and luckily they have been able to recuperate from it, but they still have long, lasting issues where they have to be more careful of not getting sick, because they still have those residual effects of the valley fever and other things they've had.
 
S: Was that the the so? If the experiences from your family members does that affect that you to have? You know? You know different opinion about the air quality than before you lived in, you know. La.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, I feel like now we try to be a little bit more cautious. We understand that there's like more risks in our environment. So we, we see it more prevalent in our family that we. We tend to have air purifiers in our houses.
To try to at least cleanse the inside of the homes a little bit more. But yes, it does affect us, and we we have a little bit more awareness of our surroundings and our air quality compared to when we used to live in La.
 
S: In what ways do air quality affect your daily activities?
 
[Participant #36]: So the air quality well, right now, like, if we want to be playing outside with my kiddo, I have to make sure that the air quality is good enough for him to actually be outside outdoors. If not, and my pets to my pets. I have 2 dogs, and they're indoor dogs.
I try to not have them outside at all, too, unless they have to, like, you know. Play a little bit and use the restroom. But I I tend to try to keep them inside, too, because of the heat and the air quality.
 
S: So how did you check the air quality.
 
[Participant #36]: Well, right now we usually use like the weather app. We just check a little bit. Everything there it kind of gives us a brief summary. How accurate is. I'm not 100, but it's better than just guessing. So we kind of see the weather, and then it kind of gives us like an idea of like color coding and like giving us advice of like, Okay, you know, today is going to be windy, alert. You know, it's going to be bad air quality day. So we kind of take a little bit more precautions when we see that.
 
S: From my opinion whether app is not super accurate. So when the day with the air quality the weather app says the quality is quite moderate.
From my eyesight I can see dust everywhere, and my eyesight is really short. So have you ever, you know, experienced something like that?
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, especially in certain areas, because, I work more towards the downtown area where there's more buildings. But we live. We have lived and live currently more in the outskirts. So in the outskirts, you see more dust actually in the air, because you're closer to actual agriculture and more manufacturing companies.
But in downtown, like, when you're actually working in the city, you actually don't encounter that as frequent because you can with the buildings that kind of, and and so much commuting. You don't tend to see it as much as when you're outside in the exterior part of the city.
 
S: Hmm, so have you modified any work or personal activities due to the air quality concerns like dust.
 
[Participant #36]: I have not like work. Wise? No. Because, luckily, like with vehicles and all that we, you know, we can kind of well, I mean, I would think that we could protect ourselves a little better, but maybe not so much, but at least like exterior activities, like personal activities. Yes, we do try to minimize outdoor activities, if possible. Even though it's it's a nice day outside. Sometimes I don't trust it. So we just prefer to stay indoors, and like we, we have like a treadmills and stuff. But inside.
 
S: Have you ever changed the the date of the event, or the date of the meeting with your friends because of the air quality.
  
[Participant #36]: Outdoor events. Yes, but not indoor events, indoor events. because people tend to commute more using vehicles, and it's indoors with like no, but if there are door events, we do kind of tend to be a little bit more cautious, especially when there's fires, because recently we have had a little bit more fires around. I know that the other day my nephew was going to have a game, and it got canceled because of the air quality, because there was a fire nearby. so they had to cancel and postpone the game.
 
S: Hmm, okay, has air quality ever affected your work, productivity, or attendance.
 
[Participant #36]: Not my work productivity, but I feel like my personal health has been affected by it. but not like work itself. because my job doesn't really require me to be that physical. It requires just mainly to just kind of sit and be on the computer.
 
S: Okay? So what actions have you taken to deal with the challenges of air quality?
 
[Participant #36]: Well, just the air purifiers inside the house and at work. We also have some air purifiers around the building and then we also have limited our external like activities. And we have.
I mean, that's kind of it. I mean, I I do wanna take more actions. But as of right now. That's the only thing we have done.
 
S: Okay, I think that's good. So have you noticed that? Theothers around you had also impacted by the air quality outside of your family members.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes. So people who are like my, my relatives and family member friends that have health issues like actual like asthma, or have more like bronchitis, or I've noticed bronchitis is a little bit more prevalent here in Bakersfield, too. But it's it has affected them like I see little kids more with the little asthma mask during the treatments here.
I mean,  I feel like it does play a factor also with, I mean, of possible other causes of health issues that I've seen other little kids with and stuff. So I feel like it does affect us drastically.
 
S: So how do you feel when the kids are, you know, having those kind of asthma treatment like mask because of the air quality.
 
[Participant #36]: Well, I it makes me feel sad because I feel like they are limited to their childhood experience because of it. They have to limit when they can go out. They have to limit what they wear when they come out. Because, I mean, sometimes I know, especially people that work in the agriculture. And you know, younger people, they have to wear masks and like, try to cover up extra like, put extra layers in this heat. And the little kids that sometimes are like near those areas, too. They have to also wear extra layers like masks and stuff, too.
 
S: Yeah, so you're compassionate to the kids and bakersfield, I can feel it. does that feeling increased because because you're mom. So were those perspective changed before you have, child. or after a child. I think now that I'm a mom, I'm a little bit more observant of how everything affects other kids, too, and my own kid, too. 
Yes, yes, so I do believe it does have a play in how I feel my perspectives.
So because so after you became mom, you became more. Do you think you could? Became more sensitive to the air quality.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, I feel like now. It makes me concerned of Well, if they can't go out, especially if they're a little bit sick like. Usually we're the kind of people that. Oh, they'll get better. But now it's like, Nope, let's not risk it with, you know, even contributing the bad air quality into their like them being sick and stuff.
 
S: So if you knew that the baker field are suffering from the air quality issue, would you? So if you go back when you were in LA.
Would you? How did you make a decision? Whether you about moving to Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #36]: If I were to go back in time and like make considerations like this. I would maybe think about it a little bit more, just because I'm a little bit more aware now of like valley fever. I mean things that you weren't exposed hearing in like bigger towns, bigger cities. But I feel like.
If I would have still considered coming to Bakersfield without a child, I probably would have just done the move again, but if I already had a child, I feel like I would have contemplated my options a little bit better, and actually done some more research before I have done the move. Now for me to actually move out. I think it's a little more complex because.
All my family is here, so I feel like we can live with it. But we have to kind of balance our how we deal with it.
S: How comfortable are people in your workplace with discussing air quality concerns.
 
[Participant #36]: For the most part, I think because I mean I'm not trying to like discriminate, but I think because most of my. The people in my office are older. I think they actually have seen a little bit more of the consequences.
but, because a lot of them have lived here all their lives. I feel like they kind of dismiss it a little bit more because they don't know other like other cities, like the quality. Some people have never even traveled outside of Bakersfield.
 
S: So you are thinking that your evaluation is that general attitude toward you know, talking about health topics around air quality is not that positive they're not talking a lot.
 
[Participant #36]: No, there's not that much talking.
 
S: Okay, so you moved from La to Bakersfield. And actually, you are new outsider. So when you think, when you work with the people who has born and raised in Bakersfield.
Have you ever felt lonely because you feel that you're the only one who feel sensitive to the air quality issue in Bakersfield. You said the older generation in your workplace. They don't really, really, you know bothered about air quality.
 
[Participant #36]: Work I feel like, yes, I feel like it's something that I wouldn't really feel comfortable discussing with a lot of people, because since they have lived here all their life. They don't really see a problem with it.
Yeah. So I feel like at work. I'm not that comfortable.
 
H: Can you come up? Maybe perhaps tell us an example. a situation where you were, where your concerns were dismissed, or where you felt uncomfortable after just trying to, you know. Bring up this issue. Do you have a case that you can? You might be able to share with us.
Air quality, I mean, the environment, valley fever, those kind of issues. I mean, right?
 
[Participant #36]: Okay? Well, because a lot of people in my job are very Bakersville native.
And they're used to this. They don't really discuss valley fever so kind of discuss valley fever, because a lot of the people that I know, have had valley fever are not necessarily Bakersfield natives. They kind of dismiss it where it's like, oh, like it's it's an exaggeration like oh, it's just the flu.
Oh, it's just you're fine. You're fine, but I don't know if it has to do to the because most of the people in my my job are native Bakersfield. They're politically. They're a little bit too.
they don't believe in a lot of stuff.
 
H: I understand. Okay, that tells a lot. Okay. Thank you.
 
S: Oh, can you? So? I think this is a new information I have found from you, not from the other interview. I think this is really valuable moment from us. I really appreciate it. So you said, air quality is related to political things. Can you elaborate more about it?
 
[Participant #36]: Well, I mean I don't think one or the other is good or bad, but I am observant, and I acknowledge what's going around me, and a lot of the people in my office are more right, so more Republican, and they I mean a lot of not all of them, but many I've heard discuss things about like vaccines, and they've discussed like things that they're not really.
It's kind of like the valley fever. They don't really acknowledge that it really exists, that necessity of stuff. But I think it's also true, because it has not affected them personally like valley fever, and even though they're natives. I don't know how it hasn't affected them, but I feel like they just don't.
They don't acknowledge the air quality and like anything because of how they're set in stone, and they're like mine and what they've experienced. I feel like when you experience it. You kind of have a little bit more of open mind. But they I mean, they don't even believe in vaccines.
 
S: In your workplace, Do you have any experience that when your colleagues also shared personal or family concerns related to the air quality with you.
 
[Participant #36]: Honestly. No, I feel like they might. They might reference like, Oh, it's like, because in my office a lot of the people during their breaks. They like to go walk around because since it is an office environment, a lot of them were were just sitting down to work. It's not like. It doesn't really require us physically to do much, so they'll take breaks. So if it's a little bit more windy outside, or like a little bit like where you can tell the quality is kind of smoggy. Then we hold up. Don't do that yet. We they end up not going out so they are a little bit more observant, but usually the people who are walking are a little bit younger.
Like the older bakers. Natives don't really go out and walk. It's mainly like the younger generations that kind of want to. They actually care about their health a little bit more that are actually walking.
So they're they're actually observing of, like the air quality at that moment, not to the point where they look at apps or anything. They just kind of play by ear, like what the what it looks like.
 
S: Okay, have you ever wanted to wear a mask, but felt hesitant, due to social concerns around you?
 
[Participant #36]: After Covid. Yes, because now, if you have a mask, you are looked like oh, especially because now it's not mandated. People look at you like. Oh, what does she have like? Oh, so yes, that does concern us, and we do kind of play it by ear. If we wear a mask or not, sometimes. Depending where we are.
 
S: Okay, so have you ever tried to use wear mask in your office?
 
[Participant #36]: Due to air quality. No
due to like illness, like where I either I'm sick or other people's are sick. Yes, I have.
 
S: I'm looking for alternative questions. I can have
So how do you think your coworkers would react if you regularly discussed or regular discuss about the air quality concerns or issues.
 
[Participant #36]: I think they would just think that I'm exaggerating and just not like just making things up.
 
S: Yeah. But you did you ever try to talk about it?
 
[Participant #36]: Not on a regular basis, like sometimes, if you can visibly see that the air quality is musty, like kind of cloudy, then yes, we kind of have discussed it like when we know that there's fires nearby, because in the valley we do tend to have decent amount of fires around us, even if it's just regular home fires, whatever so when it when it actually comes to an actual event, where they know that there's a fire, I feel like it's more open to the discussion.
But when you're just discussing like, randomly like, oh, bigger, so has really bad air quality. I feel like it would be more like a just dismissive like. Oh, you're just exaggerating, but if they know that there is something going on like a fire nearby, then yes, they might kind of be a little bit more open to the conversation.
 
S: So when you feel that so you you said you try not to talk about the general air quality issue with others in your workplace.
In that moment, how do you feel when you cannot reveal your you know your genuine concerns about your quota.
 
[Participant #36]: In my job because of what I kind of expressed already about their perspectives and their beliefs. 
I kind of don't really feel bad about it, just because I kind of don't really talk about a lot of stuff with them because of their views.
So, I don't feel bad about not being able to talk about that one item, because I really try to keep my opinions, and like concerns to myself, sometimes because of how I can be received and dismissed.
 
S: Oh, so the reason why you don't talk about the air quality concerns is that because of their attitude.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, like dismissive, and their own views like, I just rather not even discuss it. Sometimes there might be one or 2 people here that you feel more comfortable, that yes, we can discuss it more like, naturally, but just in general overall, like just talking about everybody inside the office, I probably would be a little bit more reserved about speaking about many things, even personal beliefs of every anything, just my beliefs of how bakers feel their quality like it's just anything. But if you I do have like one or 2 comfortable people where I can feel more liberty of like discussing daily like, oh, you know, today I didn't feel comfortable going out like, luckily, you know, the parking lots right here, like, maybe we can have that kind of discussions. But it's very minimum.
 
S: So sometimes people feel a sense of connection if they face common challenges like air quality concerns or asthma, and if they share those kind of concerns. They feel like connection, right?
You say that those kind of feeling is quite, you know. You don't feel much about it in your workplace.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, I feel like a lot of people don't discuss that type of topics.
 
S: But outside of your organization, when you learn that your friend or others like Participant #36, who share similar environmental concerns, how does that affect you?
 
[Participant #36]: I feel good when people actually feel the liberty to talk to me, because when somebody brings it up I feel comfortable to talk about it, too, but I tend to not bring it up myself, like as a new topic. If somebody's talking about it, I feel free to discuss it, but if if nobody brings it up, I don't discuss it.
 
S: about this research, Participant #36, you know, shared this opportunity to you. How does information brought up in your discussion.
 
[Participant #36]: Well, actually, she was she was taking the interview in the lunchroom. and she kind of because we were like, oh, are you having an interview like a job interview at the workplace.
So she kind of mentioned it. And then she's like, Oh, like they're doing research like, would you.
 
H: Anything to break.
 
[Participant #36]: And we're like, well, yeah, I would love to participate like I've lived. I mean, I have comparison between cities today's state. And then, I feel like I. I have a different perspective, too, because I have a child that has been diagnosed with something that I feel like my environment did play a role, but potentially into that. Because since there's no specific thing that tells you this causes autism, I feel like it did play a possible role in that. Yeah, your signature.
 
S: So you said, your colleagues in your workplace.
They are limited of understanding about your concerns, about air quality issue. And how does that affect your thoughts or perspective related to the air quality in Bakersfield?
 
[Participant #36]: I mean, it makes me feel bad because I feel like I live in a very conservative town, that a lot of the things are not very open to discussion.
but I feel like I can live with it. I feel like I can make adjustments, and, like, you know, live with it like my kiddo. I'm trying to just make sure that you know I try to remove any toxins that I can. I try to teach his diet. I mean anything that I can do to help I do, just because even if I were to move somewhere else, we run the risk of the same thing, I mean, just in general California itself. It's very overpopulated. I mean, the the things we have around is is not. We don't have a lot of options, especially when it comes to financially available to us.
 
S: Hmm, yeah. Okay, so financially, affordable house and living costs. Actually, that attract you to the Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #36]: Yes, the but then, yeah. But I mean in La, because we come from Culver City and Culver City is pretty pretty nice. There's no interpreter. Maybe you don't put anything in there. You're good, so it's just that one, and you just have to sign those
But yeah, so I feel like, I, yeah, I really wouldn't move right now, just because I you know, I have to to deal with like my my family being here and like availability. Okay, do you want me to carry it or no? And so that can be assigned in case you need it.
But yeah, I feel like, overall I am concerned. I am aware of my surroundings, but I don't think that I would make a change in my environment because of it. Just because I feel like we have options of like paying you know, buying air filter, or like being able to reduce our outdoor activities. And you know, limit just time wise, because sometimes I feel like the air quality is a little bit worse during like mid morning day. So I feel like in the night time. I feel like the quality because it's less
  
S: so in your workplace, when you cannot discuss air quality concerns openly.
how does that affect your confidence in your own? You know, experiences in your workplace.
 
[Participant #36]: it does make me feel bad that I feel like I can't really discuss it, because I feel like they haven't experienced it themselves. They just kind of disregard it. So I do feel a little bad about that, but I feel like now, more with time. I feel like I am meeting more people that are being affected personally, whether either themselves or like their family members. So with everything, with autism, with like asthma, with valley fever. So I feel like I do have a community that I feel comfortable where I can discuss it, but I just feel like at the workplace. It's not one of them.
 
S: What would it feel like to have colleagues in your workplace who truly understand your environmental health concerns.
 
[Participant #36]: I think we would feel a little bit more comfortable speaking about a little bit more topics being a little bit more open, just because I feel like we can provide each other some supportive comments where like, let's say, somebody doesn't know how bad the air quality is. They could be like. Oh, you know what this day. I don't think you should do this because they're going to be doing this or recommendations because we care about each other type of thing like being more supportive with each other. whereas right now I feel like it's more just like oh, more, a little bit more taboo where it's like, well, we discuss other things, but not our own beliefs of a lot of things because of the political differences.
 
S: So in your workplace, so do you have any recommendation for your manager or your company?
How they could change their culture to, you know, make people freely talk about their environmental concerns or other concerns as well.
 
[Participant #36]: I feel like. If I can recommend something I probably will recommend where even the company itself is a little bit more open of discussing like, like putting bulletins or something where they're like, Hey, you guys, you know, be cautious with your surroundings.
you guys need to make sure that you know for safety precautions. You guys wear masks, or I mean not that they obligate it, but at least that they have it as an option.
 
S: Okay, so one more thing. So we are in the process of conducting a interview. And do you have any record questions we can have to our future interview that you think that it could help our research.
 
[Participant #36]: I think if personally, they have seen anybody affected with any conditions that might be influenced by like this, this like health issues like asthma, valley fever or potential, just environmental, that can be contributed by that. I think that would be beneficial to because, like that, you guys can kind of see like if the perspective changes if they encounter that personally like. And if I mean mothers too, I feel like that helps too.
 
S: Hmm.
 
S: okay. I think that's all for our interview, and I will soon send you a Amazon gift card within an hour, and thanks for joining us, and I hope you have a great day, Participant #36.
 
[Participant #36]: Thank you, too. Thank you. If anything, let me know. Take care.
