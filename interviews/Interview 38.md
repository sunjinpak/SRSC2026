# Interview 38

## Transcript
 
[Participant #38]: Sure, I'm the data analyst and prospect lead in university advancement. So what that means is, I work in the kind of the back end of every software of university advancement. So I do all of the syncing between systems updating of the softwares updating of contact information for everyone, and I manage the alumni database of record. So that's what I do.
 
S: Yes, cool. Actually, I'm doing. Hr. Analytics.
 
[Participant #38]: Oh, really.
 
S: Yeah. But it's mostly about using the data from the survey. So maybe we can chit chat later after the interview. Just curious what you are doing for the and for analyzing the data.
 
[Participant #38]: Oh, sure, yeah, I do. A lot of fundraising, reporting and alumni engagement reporting. So that's mindless.
 
S: Okay. So you know which kind of demographics, you know, place most, you know. Donation. Do you do something like that? Analyzing.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, similar to that, for sure.
 
S: Okay. Okay.
 
[Participant #38]: Age ranges. Like the that kind of thing.
 
S: Very interesting. Okay, does your work require physical presence.
 
[Participant #38]: No, I actually, I work remotely 4 days out of the week, and I'm on campus one day of the week.
 
S: Oh, that's great. So can you walk us through a typical day including your working hours and after work hours.
 
[Participant #38]: Sure. So I'm a very early riser, especially during the summer, when it's so hot outside. So I try to get up before the sun even, and then I've been trying to take daily walks in the morning. I try to do those long before it's super hot earlier in the morning, like before. 8 am. Really. And then most of my day is spent working at a computer other than the quick little walk that I take for 15 min. It's a lot of sitting, so I have my standing desk that I move up and down and then I I try to like every other weekend or so get out and go do something in the community as well. But really a lot of my time is just spent at my house.
S: Recently I read a research that remote, remote worker feel lonely because they don't have much connection with their colleagues. But if they have some kind of volunteering activity with your community outside of their work hours actually, that could support their loneliness. So do you feel something similar like that?
 
[Participant #38]: I definitely especially for the 1st few years of the pandemic. When everyone was working from home, I felt that a lot and then last year, actually, we're coming up on one year of me going into the office once a week because I felt like I was missing out on a lot of those interpersonal communications and relationships with people. So that's why I I have one day in the office, even though my work doesn't require it. I I choose to go in just to be able to not be so alone.
 
S: Oh, okay. So you have volunteered to be in the office and interact with your people. So it seems like you are, you know. Facing the heat during the day. So how long have you lived in Bakersfield?
 
[Participant #38]: I was born and raised here so.
 
S: Hmm, okay. So your parents also born and raised here, or or they came from other State origin.
 
[Participant #38]: My mom was born in Boron, California. It's just outside of Barstow. So that's Eastern Kern. And then my dad was born in Fresno. So they both moved to Bakersfield, and then met each other.
 
S: Okay, so. But your family, your parents also lived around, you know, San Joaquin Valley.
 
[Participant #38]: Yes.
 
S: so how do you feel about the air quality in South Hawking Valley? I think you have pretty much of knowledge because your parents, and you lived here for quite a long time.
 
[Participant #38]: My! My opinion is, it's it's very bad. I remember growing up in elementary school. We had to have like bad air quality days where you weren't allowed to have recess outside. So you had to have like a movie playing in the cafeteria just because it was too bad to like, try and go. even play, let alone like, do physical education. And then, like, I remember in high school, we had to have PE like set up in certain different ways, and even during like the summer my PE had to end before 11 Am. Because otherwise it was either too hot or the air quality was too bad.
Even like trying to play sports. I was diagnosed with asthma when I was very young, so I couldn't really play sports very well, even though I tried so. It's it's been a huge impact. I think on just kind of like how I choose to interact with outside, because it's so bad out there most of the time. So, and even with like trying to make sure we have enough frequency of replacing air filters and taking medication, and all of that kind of stuff just something that I think I'm thinking about pretty regularly in Bakersfield.
 
S: Yeah. So do you have air purifier for each room in your house.
 
[Participant #38]: No, we only have the one in the bedroom, and then we replace our central air filter. We try to do it once a month.
 
S: So you lived in Bakersfield for quite a while. Did your perspective on the air quality here an issue change during that time.
 
[Participant #38]: I think it's more of. Just as I grew up and learned more, I came to recognize and understand more of what people were talking about around me.
 
S: So, as you became more knowledgeable about the air quality, you became more aware of the the concerns about the air quality issue and the quality of about the air quality issues. Right.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah.
 
S: Looking back, would you say your thinking has shifted compared to how you saw in the past in terms of air quality. So like sometime. Some people might think that air quality has been improved  for you know, for 20 decades, but some people might think that air quality might been worsened, or some people might think that air quality is just the same. How do you think.
 
[Participant #38]: Honestly, I haven't really felt much of a difference in air quality personally. So that's kind of how I would judge that. I don't really get a lot of reports of it's improved or not improved either way. So I just go off of my own personal experience, and it seems the same to me.
 
S: Okay. So you said, your perspective on the air quality and the quality about air in Bakersfield is quite same. But were there any specific, you know, moment or event, or, you know, knowledge like belly fever, or conversation with the other really changed your thought about the air quality issue.
 
[Participant #38]: I think it's a kind of a constant thing that I've been told to be aware of right. It's especially just like growing up here and hearing like you don't want to go out into the field when there's too much wind, because you might get valley fever from in the air and those types of things. So it's it's something that I've just always been cautious of. I wouldn't say anything has changed, but it is definitely something I think about and consider.
 
S: For your awareness about the air quality issue that your parents took a biggest role.
 
[Participant #38]: I think it was a combination of my parents in my school learning that, you know you weren't allowed to go outside for this period of time, or Hey, the air is bad. Today we're going to do PE inside, or even my parents saying, Remember to take your inhaler with you when you go to play outside those types of things was something that kind of made me think more and more about the air quality and consider it more.
 
S: So looking back, were there any occasion you had to change your you know, daily schedules, because of the air quality issue.
 
[Participant #38]: Not since I was in school. No, I I don't tend to get out much. So and I do think that helps.
 
S: But you said, you are walking during the morning. Do you think that morning the air quality is better than the other time?
 
[Participant #38]: I really am more thinking about the temperature when I walk. not thinking about the air quality, although now that I am talking in general. My husband started working out in the fields, looking for endangered species in oil fields.
And when he started that job it did make me start to think about the air quality for him a little more often, and learning more about like how they have to work out those issues and put sometimes wear like an N 95, or something like that while they're walking and that kind of stuff. So I think that has definitely made me change my opinion on the air quality and be a little more aware of it just for his sake.
 
S: how about your work productivity or your work schedule? Did ever the air quality had been impacted? How you work.
 
[Participant #38]: I think, since I am such a kind of behind the scenes software person, it hasn't, there's there's not really anything that happens with the air quality that affects what I do on a day to day basis. So no, not really.
 
S: Yeah, I think that's quite natural, because, you don't need to be an outside like your husband. For your work. But how about the others around you? I'm thinking about your colleagues. I know that your colleagues introduced this interview research. And definitely, I think that you and your colleague. Talk about air quality issue as well. Have you noticed that the air quality impacted your colleagues in your workplace?
 
[Participant #38]: Definitely, I think every time a new person from outside of the San Joaquin Valley moves to Bakersfield, we try to warn them right and let them know, like you're probably gonna get sick the 1st couple of weeks you're here like, hey? When it's warmer out, or when there's lots of wind out. We we try to make sure they're aware, like, or sharing tips of like. Hey, here's the the allergy medication that works really well for me in this time of year that that kind of stuff. So I try to caution people when they just move here that like, Hey, the air is different. You're gonna it's gonna take some getting used to. It does feel a little like stickier is what I hear from people. It feels stickier in the air. But since I haven't lived anywhere else, I can't say the big differences. Just try to give them a little bit of a heads up.
 
S: Okay. I wish you were my colleague, because when I 1st came here in 2022, they only warned me about valley fever.
 
[Participant #38]: Oh, one's really bad, too.
 
S: Okay, when you educate your newcomers in your workplace, how did they respond.
 
[Participant #38]: I think a lot of the times people maybe underestimate it. And then once they once they get that 1st like sickness that everybody seems to get within the 1st like month or 2 of living here. Then they're like, Oh, no, you you were. You were.
 
S: You're right, and then does that when the newcomers finally realize that your you know, your warning was true. How? How? How did that, you know, affect the relationship between you and the newcomers.
 
[Participant #38]: I think it's just something that we kind of can can relate about now is it's almost like you. You feel like you've been baptized by fire, by the bad air quality. Now, now, you can relate. So we have this this kind of quick thing that we can say like, oh, yeah, air quality is really bad today. Watch out to each other kind of stuff. So I think it. If anything gave us another topic to talk about.
 
S: I love it.
 
[Participant #38]: Didn't feel like it made any like anything negative happen in our in our relationships at all.
 
S: Okay, okay. So you think that you know, you know, usually the bad environment actually, negatively affects people's health. But sometimes bad air quality that could make all people affected that could help build a relationship, especially in Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, I think it. It just kind of helps everybody get to the same level of understanding, not trying to say that bad air quality is a good thing, right? It's not. But at least after a while we we all kind of can sit here and say, Yeah, we know the air quality is bad. We've experienced this together. We've been through this together.
Almost like a trauma bond.
 
S: Trauma bond. Yeah, I think that's a really good, you know term, because actually, we are research about the trauma bond.
But I didn't actually say about it, because I need to, you know, extract those kind of concepts naturally from the interview. So thank you very much.
 
[Participant #38]: Sure.
 
S: So can you talk us more about the trauma bond? Are there any, you know, you know, kind of case or experiences? Can you share with us, because I would like to introduce in my research about the concept of trauma bond.
 
[Participant #38]: I think, like I. I can't think of any individuals specifically that where I could give you like an exact example. But I will say overall anytime. The air quality is above like 1 2135 everybody in the office, especially when I'm actually physically in the office to talk to people. We always end up talking about it. And it becomes this kind of  it's a connection that we all get to share. And then, even whenever we're talking to like other people outside of San Joaquin Valley, we we still know between all of us like Oh, yes, but we have this connection that they don't have with us. Kind of thing. I don't. I'm sorry, but I can't think of like an exact moment of trauma bond between me and another individual, and not not right now.
 
S: Thank you very much. You elaborate a lot because we knew that when there's a day with us, especially with bad air quality. You feel those kind of feelings. So I think that's a really good you know. I find a new information from there in your workplace. How comfortable are people in your workplace with discussing air quality concerns. You, said you are quite comfortable educating the newcomers, but there might be some people who might not be feeling quite comfortable talking about that. Have you ever noticed that.
 
[Participant #38]: I don't think so. I'm not usually the after somebody 1st moves here, and I try to warn them a little bit and give them some tips. I'm not usually the one who brings up the air quality. After that, I think, because I just I don't even. It's like my regular life. But the newcomers will always bring it up again, and then and then we'll talk about it. And I I'm comfortable talking to anyone about it. I just don't even think about it's like the sun is yellow, like it's just their quality is bad.
 
S: Okay. So talking about the environmental Health or air quality issue is quite the general of talking about that is quite neutral in your workplace.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, I would say so.
 
S: Have you ever shared your personal concerns and family concerns about air quality with your colleagues?
 
[Participant #38]: I think, at 1 point. Yes, whenever my parents lived here, and they're retired now. So I was getting a little more concerned about their health. But now I don't have any family that lives within the San Joaquin Valley anymore. So I don't really talk about my family. I have had other people tell me about their family, like when their kids 1st move here and their kids get sick.
Or maybe they're moving away to try and make their kids have a healthier air quality. That's something that I've heard from people before, too. So that's something that we we do talk about.
 
S: Did your parent move to other region? Maybe because of the air quality issue.
 
[Participant #38]: They did so they purchased a house up in the San Joaquin mountains. So to try and get kind of up and away from the bad air quality. But then they did ultimately move into North Dakota, just because that's where my sister is. So they wanted to be closer to their grandkids.
 
S: Okay. Okay. North Dakota. Wow.
S: Yeah, I haven't imagined me living there. But maybe it's probable. Yeah. okay, so have you ever wanted to take mask, but felt hesitant due to the social pressure.
 
[Participant #38]: Hmm! I think Covid really kind of changed that for us. There, it's a little more socially acceptable now. And but I don't ever really tend to grab one whenever there's a bad air quality day. No. but not because of any sort of social pressure. Just.
 
S: You know.
 
[Participant #38]: I don't think about it.
 
S: Yeah. And since you're wearing glasses, I also wear glasses. So I hate taking masks because of it, you know, blurs my sight as well.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah. It fogs up the glasses, for sure.
 
S: I'm look. I'm searching for the next questions. I think you were. You're wonderful full on asking many of the questions. So, okay, so you said, trauma bond. So I really like that term.
So when you learn that the others shared similar environmental concerns, how does that affect you?
 
[Participant #38]: Affect me personally.
 
S: Like we're feeling, you know, or you know.
 
[Participant #38]: I think a lot of the time I do tend to want to defend Bakersfield when people are saying, Oh, the air quality is so bad here, I want to say, Well, it's not. It's not our fault, though, like this isn't because Bakersfield is really bad at producing negative pollution into the air or anything, and then I like, go into the usual oh, you know we're a bowl, and everything kind of falls down into us, so we just get all of the bad air from everyone. Just kind of settles here.
I don't tend to react that way any longer, because I do feel that more and more people have learned that. And it's not just like a you dirty Bakersfield thing. It's more of like a Oh, Bakersfield has bad air quality thing which is nice. I tend to be pretty proud of the fact that I'm from Bakersfield. I know a lot of people aren't but growing up here, and hearing all of the the kind of negativity made me want to defend us even more so.
 
S: Do you find that some people try not to talk about air quality issue in Bakersfield because they love Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #38]: I do wonder that sometimes for a lot of people. I I do think they try to just avoid talking about it, because they want to pretend that it's not happening for me. It's more of like, I'm aware that it is happening, and it's something that needs to be addressed. Not something that needs to be like pushed under the rug and tried to be ignored. And I think that's what some people do for the love of Bakersfield.
 
S: Yeah. I think that's a point that I'm really agreeing it. Because if you, if the people aware about air quality with the similar, you know level, I think we can make a change. But if the awareness is different across people, especially between the people who has power over many things in Bakersfield, and who does not have a power over many things like, you know, farm workers. You know, there are the people who are affected by the air quality issue, and also pesticides as well. I think in that case we cannot change the game in Bakersfield.
Have you ever noticed that talking about the air quality issue lead them to talk about political issue as well? Because, you know, some people think that in the right wing. They some of the people don't talk about the air quality issue.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, I do think that eventually it turns into a political it's for some reason environmental things have become political, which is unfortunate. But yeah, it it does. And then it it's policies. And everyone discusses like, Oh, well, who has the water rights? I do find water rights tends to be the one that leads more political than air quality, though. But I think both tend to go that way. Yeah.
 
S: If you have colleagues, who think that water rights and air quality issue is quite related to the political discussion, do you tend to avoid talking about air quality issue with them.
 
[Participant #38]: Just mostly to avoid politics. Yeah, I would say, so. Yeah.
 
S: So can you share a little bit about that case? Because, I just wanted to introduce why people introduce in the research paper that why people don't want to talk about air quote issue.
 
[Participant #38]: I think. If if I'm talking to someone about Bakersfield, and then the air quality comes up at  anytime that politics gets brought into that. It's usually in a way that is like a negative for Bakersfield. and I try to frame everything positively. So. If someone's talking about it in a way that maybe like it's not the way that I am. Politically, I just don't want to even try to cause conflict like that. And politics usually ends up leading to conflict. So to avoid talking about it, I'll avoid talking about the air quality with with those people. Yeah.
 
S: Yeah. And also I found that the people who stand on the left wing they tend to blame oil industry, or, you know, agriculture, industry, even though they provide lots of resources for the people in Bakersfield.
Did you also find some case that you don't want to talk about it for the people who always, you know. bring, you know, political discussion based on the left things, you know, opinions.
 
[Participant #38]: Based on left leaning opinions. No, I don't think so. I think maybe it's because and on some level I agree with that. So it's easier for me to have that so no, I wouldn't say the same thing happens with left leaning conversation.
 
S: so, have you ever felt isolated due to environmental health concerns? So you know, you might felt like, you know, you know you are the only one worried about the air quality, while others seemed unbothered. I found many male students in my class that they don't really care about the air quality issue. They just jog when eyesight is really short with the dust. I think that they really don't care about the air quality issue. And also when I said that I'm gonna start research around air quality issue. And they said I might not have many interviewees because there might be very few people having, you know, issue with the record issue. So in that sense, I felt a little bit, you know, worried, or I felt like, am I?
Am I the only one who's only sensitive about the air quality issue around me? But have you ever felt isolated like me?
[Participant #38]: I think in, in some circumstances. Yes, there are some like social engagements, maybe not in the workplace, but social engagements with people that I know in Bakersfield, who are also born and raised here. Some people don't want to ever talk about it. Don't even consider it so. Whenever you do try to bring up like, Oh, yeah, the air quality is bad the other day, and then they're like, I didn't even notice you're like, Oh, okay, well, I'll just stop talking now.
 
S: Wow, okay.
 
[Participant #38]: But with my colleagues I don't think I've ever felt that way. No. It does feel like, since we have so many transplants that that's that's what causes a lot of that concern. And then it makes everyone else kind of empathize with them.
S: I could definitely find that your colleagues in your department really open to talk about the air quality issue. So that's why many of your folks volunteer to, you know, participate in this research.
 
[Participant #38]: Oh, yeah. Andrea asked us if we wanted to, and we were like, yes, of course.
 
S: Yeah. So when you feel that the person in front of you are not comfortable talking about the air quality issue, and they don't understand the air quality issue like you.
How did that impact the discussion between you and them?
 
[Participant #38]: I would say it just it changed the whole thing. It made me not want to talk about it with with them, because it's it's not something they think is important. So if if someone is like gonna maybe not pay attention to what I'm saying, then I don't wanna waste my breath on it.
 
S: So in that moment you're having some kind of feeling that you want to just talk about only work related issue.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, I think so. I think because it's like, I'm trying to give you a little bit of a heads up or like, Hey, this, this thing may negatively impact you. And they're like, Oh, it's not a big deal. Then I'm like, Okay, well, then, I guess we'll just move on, and I'll I'll stop talking about it.
 
S: Okay, okay. But in the other case, if the person fully understand your concerns and trying to compassion about it, then your discussion became more rich.
 
[Participant #38]: Yes, for sure.
 
S: Okay? And do you think that  those kind of feeling is something similar to you know social connection with your colleagues.
 
[Participant #38]: I could say so. Yeah, I do think that the more the people I talk to on a regular basis are also the people I talk to the most about the air quality.
The better the relationship I have with the people, the the more we end up talking about it.
S: So talking about the air quality issue and understanding each other's concern around air quality issue, you said that that could, you know, help the relationship between you and your colleagues. And with that, colleagues with those discussion.
how does that affect the relationship between you and the organization as a whole?
 
[Participant #38]: How does my conversations with my colleagues affect my relationship to my employer or organization?
 
S: Yes.
 
[Participant #38]: I would say, it's it's kind of made me talk to my supervisor more about it. But I don't know past that. If it's impacting the organization as a whole.
But it has like come up because of the discussions with these people. It's come up in conversation more often with leadership, which I think is nice. I think it takes those conversations amongst colleagues, 1st in order for everyone to feel comfortable enough to then bring it up to us.
 
S: Okay, okay, I think that's a really great point. Because usually our employees are the Mirror of the organization. But if you think that most of your employees have a good relationship with you.
then you might also feel that you could have a good relationship with your organization as well, so you could brought up air quality, issue topics, and also other topics as well with the confidence right.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, yeah, you get some practice in, I think, as well.
 
S: Okay. So all right.
So talk. So I just wanted to hear from your own voice, because my my conversation actually does not apply to the research. So do you think that talking about the air quality issue with your colleagues, actually build up your confidence in your workplace?
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, I would say so. I think every conversation with my colleagues does that. But air quality is one that is. Since we we did speak about the political side of air quality. Right is, if you start talking about air quality, you know that there is a chance that you could end up going into a political conversation. So if you're not comfortable talking to someone, then you won't be comfortable bringing up air quality, and you it just won't end up happening. So I think it does matter. I I don't know if that answered your question.
 
S: It works perfectly. Thank you very much. I know in some workplace. People are not, you know, feel comfortable talking about air quality issue. But I think in your workplace, your colleagues and you are very comfortable talking about the air quality issue and also talk about the other issue as well personal matters as well. But for the team or organization where their colleagues or employees does not feel that they are not comfortable. Talking about the air quality issue for them. What kind of support or initiative do you think that their organization could provide to better address? You know their people to talk about air quality issues.
[Participant #38]: I think of starting with awareness is always a really good idea. We have the Csub well aspect from people and culture that was recently launched this year. And I think that Monthly Newsletter is a really good awareness tool that we're already using for health and well-being for employees of the University. So I think, incorporating into that like an awareness newsletter piece for air quality, and how it's expected to perform, maybe sending out a notification to everyone. Hey? Today's air quality is going to be good or bad or if it's in a I believe 150 is the limit for it being a very dangerous day, so definitely making sure people are aware of whenever that's happening. I don't know how many of us are actually even aware of what the air quality is right now. So I think it is important to just kind of, for the for the organization to let employees know, especially on a work day, or maybe an event day like Commencement making sure that all of us are aware of the air quality on that day, because most of us are probably going to be outside for hours and hours on end.
 
S: yeah, I remember that for last undergraduate. You know, graduation ceremony. The wind was really, you know, strong. Many of the organizers only concern about whether the podium might be blown away or not not about the air quality issue.
So I think the awareness, as you said Newsletter Letter will be really helpful for all to, you know. Overcome the air quality issue while we have a important, you know, event like graduation ceremony.
kay, so we have currently doing this research. And do you think, are there any suggestion for us that we could give questions to the future interviewees?
 
[Participant #38]: I think you have a lot of really great questions. I think, asking about their daily life is really really helpful.
I'm super curious how many people you have who work like maybe what is traditionally considered to be an office job or white collar job versus like a blue collar, or and even at Csub we have people who work in grounds and facilities who are going to be maybe working outside more often.
So I think I would be interested in where I would suggest asking a question just of like, how how much of your day is expected to be outdoors by your work?
 
S: Isn't it.
 
[Participant #38]: Indoor.
 
S: okay, I think that's a brilliant, you know. Question. I think you should go to the Phd program because you brought up really good points today.
Oh, thank you. I did apply for master's program recently. So we'll see if I get in. Mpa. Or Mba.
 
[Participant #38]: I'm applying for a master of science in information technology.
The technology. Okay, yeah. Okay, I just expected to meet you in Mpa or Mba class. But yeah, but it's okay. But we can also collaborate in the near future. Because also, I'm interested in playing with the data.
 
S: Oh, well, that sounds like fun to me. Yeah, okay. Alright. I think this is it, for today's and I will send you the $40 Amazon gift card shortly, and I hope you have a great day, Participant #38.
 
[Participant #38]: Yeah, thank you so much. I love talking about all this.
 
S: Thank you.
