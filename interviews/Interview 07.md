P7: No, not really my job isn't very flexible. I work set hours
P7: and because of the nature of logistic I need to be available at specific times.
P7: So it's due for me at times, because when I need to just be at home with my family, yeah. But I've actually learned how to manage to overtime.

P7: On 6 am.
P7: and I get up. I hope my wife get the kids ready for school. Yeah. And I had to walk
P7: at the office.
P7: I spend my time
P7: coordinating shipments and resolving delays, and also checking in with the drivers. Then, after work, I usually go home.
P7: I have dinner with my family, and I try to unwind with some TV or a book before bed.
P7: Yeah. And it's just how I live my life daily. And I just make it work that way.
K: Okay.
K: So I know you talked about your family. Could you tell me a bit more about your family, and who you live with, and how long you've been living with, like how long you've been married, and all that personal stuff, if you don't mind.
P7: Okay, I live with my wife, and we have 3 kids. My wife.
P7: yeah. She walks by tab
P7: as a teacher. So she has a lot of of the household responsibilities.
P7: We're also doing that.
P7: Yeah. And we are Happy family. And we're also kind of a busy family, too.
P7: Yeah. Because we are both working.
P7: And well, we've been married now for over a
P7: for what? 10 years we are doing 10 to 12 years.
P7: Yeah, we are kind of a busy family. But we actually have time for each others on weekends. Yeah, yeah.
K: Beautiful. Let me tell you, kids are a blessing man. So you're blessed.
K: Yeah, okay, so how long have you lived in the San Joaquin Valley. What brought you here.
P7: I've lived in San Joaquin Valley for about 8 years on
P7: for work opportunities, and because it was more affordable than other parts of California.
P7: Yeah, that was mainly bought me the job opportunity at the job.
P7: And it's quite cheap compared to other regions in California.
P7: Yeah.
P7: And things I like about the area is the sense of community. Everyone has always been together through 12. Yeah. And it's just this environmental challenge that we have to just
P7: to just deal with.
K: Okay, perfect. How do you feel about the air quality in the San Joaquin Valley?
P7: Oh, about the air quality.
P7: Is a major concern.
P7: and, in fact, on some days the ace is so bad you can't even see the mountains in the distance.
P7: and for me it's frustrating, especially because, like, there is no much being done to like address this situation.
P7: It has always been.
P7: We've just been offered just temporary solutions. Yeah, this kind of thing.
K: Okay, so in what ways does the air quality affect your daily life at work and at home?
P7: Yeah, artwork. I sometimes feel fatigued or gets headaches
P7: after I spread it like at home.
P7: we've had to limit audio activities with the kids
P7: stuff because they love playing outside.
P7: And and it has also made me think twice about staying in this area long term.
P7: Yeah, because when recognized. Aside from
P7: from our health. Yeah, the way it has depend on health and the children. Yeah. So it does not only be good.
K: So have you noticed its impact on your friends? Maybe roommates, maybe coworkers around you.
K: the about the air quality. Have you noticed anything.
P7: Yeah, of course. Some of my coworkers. Yeah. They've seemed to struggle with similar similar issues.
P7: And people. They do complain about respiratory problems.
P7: And some say the few drink
P7: on. But it is yeah. And I just feel it's something we all deal with.
P7: Yeah. And it is not really openly disclosed. I think we just
P7: people just complain. And you just look up about it. Yeah. But it's what happens, almost that happens. And people just tend to complain about the health. The health effects of it.
K: So how do concerns about your family health, and how does your family health influence your feelings?
P7: Yeah, for this. My biggest worry is about the is about how the equality will affect my kids in the long run
P7: because they are active and
P7: they love sports. Yeah. And because of this, we've had to pull them from outdoor activities on bad days.
P7: Yeah.
P7: it's actually upsetting to think that. Their health and their shadow. The experience might be compromised because of
P7: something we can't control this air bad air quality. Yeah. So we just have to just restrict them
P7: for the meantime.
K: Okay.
K: so do you think experiencing air pollution with others strengthens your sense of connectedness in your organization? Can you share some examples?
P7: Yes, of course it does. For example, doing wi-fire neighbors and coworker.
P7: They said before the yeah, and they share resources with like health eaters.
P7: Yeah. So I feel it's actually crazy sense of shared struggle within the community. Yeah, it's so it's just like a small comfort knowing
P7: and diluenties.
P7: So everybody comes together to talk about it. And we just share resources. Yeah, so it happens.
K: So how do you feel when others, for instance, your coworkers share similar experiences related to air pollution? How do you feel about that?
P7: When older people, especially my coworkers.
P7: talk about these issues. It's actually creates.
P7: For me, it creates a sense of understanding.
K: On this.
P7: Yeah.
P7: The thing is that we don't agree on solutions. Yeah. But what I notice is that there is always a mutual recognition that is something that everyone has to navigate. So we all know the problem. And we are always working active. To make sure everyone gets a solution. Yeah.
P7: and we we work together towards that. Yeah.
K: So sometimes people feel a strong bond with others when facing common challenges, like dealing with air quality. How do you feel when you share similar experiences about air quality with your colleagues like at work, or maybe in your neighborhood ?
K: How do you feel about that?
P7: I've I've shared my personal experience with my colleagues. Yeah. And what I've seen about this is it's actually assuring that we are actually facing similar challenges.
P7: Yeah. So
P7: I do not really have to ride much from them, because I know they are also facing the same thing in their household.
P7: and we would work
P7: so. And this has actually made me feel more connected to them. Yeah, knowing that we are all trying to protect our families and the best we can.
P7: So I've not really felt I I to talk about it to people where I feel they understand.
P7: It's like, it's, it's a mutual feeling. So if I feel someone is actually
P7: someone can actually reciprocate what I'm trying to do.
P7: So then we go ahead and talk about it.
K: Okay, so how has this sense of bond affected your thoughts, feelings, or actions towards your organization, about air quality?
P7: So for this.
P7: I just feel it has made me to be more aware for need of collective action. Yeah, because recently, I've started advocating for better workplace policies.
P7: Yeah, like wedding marks for us when we are outside or indoor air filtration.
P7: Yeah. And with this it has made me more mindful of my own habits. Yeah, like driving less and also posting initiatives. So I've been working on my end to make sure things are getting better for my side, because I feel this is like a collective work, is it's it's not just for the government.
P7: It starts with us. The individuals.
K: Right.
K: So have you ever shared your personal or family vulnerabilities related to air quality with your colleagues? If so, how was it received? And how did it affect your connection with them?
P7: Yeah. I've shared cases of personal vulnerability with my coworkers, and for what I could sense from discussion. I felt they they felt for me, it was more of an empathic. Relationship. Yeah. And because when I was talking to them, they also shared
P7: yeah expenses with me. Yeah, I had to talk about my underminished kids having a issue.
P7: Yeah. And and this kid comes up with asthma once in a while. So I've been very, very careful about my, that kid, yeah. Personally.
P7: I have to like, always watch out
P7: for the kids more. Yeah. So I was talking to these to my coworkers, and they were like, Oh, wow! That they are also facing
P7: like 2 to 3 of them. Talk about this, that yes, they also faced same challenges to at home. Yeah, that this has been really disturbing them about this for air quality.
P7: Yeah. So I just feel everyone is just trying to be a better man for his family. So we share ideas. And like I said earlier I do these people, I feel.
P7: deserve it. I talk to people I know they are ready to converse with me.
P7: Yeah, and also share their experience.
K: Okay.
K: So
K: moving on to some of your personal actions, what actions, if any, have you taken to deal with the challenges of air quality?
P7: For this at home.
P7: My wife and I.
P7: We've invested in air purifiers
P7: and we also try to keep our windows closed on bad ads. Yeah. And
P7: better to couple or combine airs to reduce emissions. It's not much, but I feel like I'm contributing to the solution. Because, like, I said earlier, the way to combat this bad air quality is.
P7: it's actually collective work. So I'm doing this for my end. And I feel like others who can do the same. Yeah. And at
P7: I've advocated for
P7: better air quality monitoring. Yeah. And I've suggested measures like indoor air, purifiers in in shared spaces.
K: So how do those around you like your coworkers cope with bad air quality?
P7: Yeah, so many of my coworkers. They seem to focus on short term solutions for this issue.
K: Yeah.
P7: Or most of everybody you see them wearing looks. No smart. Yeah. And some have even considered relocating
P7: in next few months or in next few years. Yeah, but for most of us there is no unlimited option.
P7: Yeah.
P7: we are going through it. Yeah. And we are hoping that one day it will be fine. Yeah.
P7: actually. And some has actually resigned out of the situation.
P7: And for people like us, we've actually accepted it as living.
P7: so we'll just cope with it for the meantime, till we'll find a better solution, or probably we'll have to relocate if it's
P7: if it's going to be good for the family.
K: Right. Right.
K: So how is your organization helping employees to overcome air quality issues? What do you think about your organization's actions?
P7: Yeah, they've actually taken small steps
P7: to help us address this quality, this air quality issues. Yeah.
P7: they provided marks for us during wildfire seasons
P7: and they also let us go home
P7: occasionally during bad season. We don't work.
P7: we doing bad seasons like that. That is quite hazardous.
P7: We work remotely.
P7: Yeah, so well for me, I just feel this. These are made. These measures are just short term management. Yeah.
P7: they can't really they can't address the good cause. I hope you understand they can't. They can't solve this
P7: permanently.
P7: Yeah. So it's just for the meantime.
K: Hmm, okay, yeah. So has support from your organization, changed your perspective on air quality issues?
P7: Okay, thanks for this question.
P7: So the limited support for my organizations
P7: especially, made me more critical for office priorities, because I I understand that they can't solve this air quality problem alone.
P7: Yeah, so I, I just think that they do this to support
P7: their employees. Yeah. So, boy, I feel
P7: if they invested in initiatives, like sponsoring going programs, yeah.
P7: or partnering with governmental organizations, I feel
P7: it might make me feel more valued. Yeah.
P7: and not connected to the company. Yes, because I because I feel like trying to do more of a long term investment instead of a short term which they are currently doing at the moment.
K: Does support from your organization, strengthen your connection to the organization, and if it does, in what ways?
P7: Yeah, for this. It's it's it does not really connect me to the organization.
P7: Because I feel I said earlier, they are doing this on on a short term level so well, I really appreciate them for what they are doing is they at least they considered us
P7: by trying to provide some equipment that would actually like protect us for the meantime. But I feel they could.
P7: because we are making money.
P7: We are, we are actually profiting. So I feel most of this money can actually go into initiatives that will be able to feel more credit to the company they can actually do more is probably they can partner with the local authorities to just make things more easier and not just provide temporary solutions.
P7: Yeah.
K: Okay.
K: so do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area long term? Why or why not?
P7: Hmm, okay
P7: for my family and I. We are not sure. If we'll stay in the San Juan Valley long term.
P7: Because, although it has been a good place for work. Yeah, yeah, that's very correct. But the environment issues are are to ignore.
P7: Yeah, so I'm my wife. So my wife and I,
P7: we've talked about relocating to a place with cleaner air
P7: and bet the opportunities for the kids.
P7: So for now we are sustained because of my job.
K: I know. I bet you.
P7: Yeah. Oh, boy, but this is not really like a managed decision. We are still thinking about this.
K: Imagine the air quality significantly improve. How do you think that would affect your life or your connection to the community?
P7: Oh, all this. Yeah, I feel if you can get normal air, everyone actually breathes. Yeah, I feel we'll spend more time outdoors with my kids. Yeah, because I love my kids so much. Because
P7: and my kids will be able to play sports without restrictions. Yeah. And I feel more optimistic about staying here. Yeah, I want to stay here more. Yeah, because this place is quite affordable than other parts of California. So a cleaner air will likely boost
P7: community model and attract more people to the area.
P7: Yes, so, and yeah, and I feel if this air quality improves it significantly.
P7: You can actually straighten local businesses in the school. Yeah, people want to come more, come more and invest in us and in the environment. Yeah, and everyone will not consider relocating.
K: Okay.
K: What potential factors can make people leave the San Joaquin Valley?
K: Do you know any potential factors that could make leave them?
P7: Yeah, of course. I do.
P7: The for for the health risk is the 1st thing. Health risk of poor air quality.
P7: Yeah. And lack of progress on environmental issues. Like, I said earlier, no one is making.
P7: Yeah, no, no one is taking the step to tackle this permanently.
P7: Yeah. And I feel if there are better opportunities somewhere else.
P7: Yeah, people might. People might leave.
P7: Yes.
K: Okay.
K: So, on the other hand, what potential factors can make people stay in San Joaquin Valley.
P7: If there are improvements in air quality. Let's say there are more investments in green initiative, and the air quality is is becoming good.
P7: Yeah. And I feel if there is more government support for for this. Yeah.
P7: I feel people want, and I know people
P7: to value more comfortable life. So if they are actually more affordable living cost.
P7: Yeah, in the environment and in the community, a few people who want to to stay. Yeah.
P7: so. But in general, I just feel they should just
P7: once. The equality is actually very okay. Who will want to stay? Yeah.
K: Okay.
K: so have you participated in, or are you aware of, any community or organizational efforts to address air pollution? How did that involvement affect your sense of belonging?
P7: Yeah. I've been saying things about initiative where company they try to
P7: try to regulate this air quality by introducing
P7: going live. They are into the environment. And I've been seeing this. They've been doing this. But I just feel they need more support.
P7: Yeah, from the Gov page.
P7: These people can't do it alone, so they need our supports. So so to make
P7: more more easier, maybe probably through financial funding
P7: or through advocacy. So I feel these people. They are trying to make things easier. And I also appreciate your research, because I know you guys are going to
P7: to take efforts to make the air quality very good. I feel that is the reason for doing this interview with you.
K: Right. Thank you for that. And last question, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with air quality or community connection in the San Joaquin Valley, that we might have missed?
P7: Yeah. I would like to talk about collective responsibility.
K: For sure.
P7: And yeah, in fact, I do talk about this with my colleagues at work. Yeah, I
P7: just up to individuals. Our efforts or more of our company's efforts, I feel, is the effort of the community. Everybody in total.
P7: Yeah. So I feel if everybody from the local business. So the government officials, if they can work together.
P7: Yeah, if you more to be much elder. A multi place. Yes.
P7: yeah. And I would like people to know more about like a public education, about air quality.
P7: Yeah, because many people don't understand how this actually affects their health.
P7: Physically, they don't know. Probably it causes damage to their respiratory system. Yeah, all these I learned online for my doctor. So I feel if you can help us.
P7: Have more advocacy about air quality and help us to instruct people on how to protect themselves.
P7: Probably by using Max or a purifier. I feel it will actually make a meaningful progress.
P7: Yeah.
K: Okay, awesome, awesome. Thank you for your time, Jerry. And I really appreciate you sharing your views on this whole research, and we appreciate your
K: interview like you taking time. And you will be getting the $20 Amazon card pretty soon around in 48 h, as I mentioned earlier. So is there anything else you would like to say in the end? Anything else.
P7: No, no, not not really. I. I think we've discussed much about this in depth. Thanks so much for.
K: Thank you.
P7: I really appreciate this.
K: Thank you, Jerry. Thank you. Have a good evening. Bye, bye.
P7: Alright, bye.
