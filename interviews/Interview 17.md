## Transcript
S: Okay, so, P17, we are with Sung Hyoun Hong. And he's my colleague
S: conducting a research on how air quality impacts Bakersfield employees
S: and Sung Hyoun, P17 we have been known for like 3 years, I think my first, I think, from my
S: first or second semester in Bakersfield, and he also went to Illinois with me to present the research
S: on workaholism. Yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Sweet, good to see you, P17.
P17: Nice to meet you.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah.
S: Yeah. So I have started this research and this research, you know, reflect my
S: life and my story around my family. So I was quite,
S: you know,
S: I faced some challenge challenging issue when I first landed in Bakersfield, because I think I thought the air quality was not the issue, and
S: in America, and but
S: you know my daughter got asthma. She at the time around 2022, she was only a 6 month baby.
S: and she got a bad asthma, and, as you know, I had to move to
S: Santa Clarita, where the air quality is sligtly good. It's not not perfect, but there's less dust over here.
S: and
S: I think that also impact other employees in Bakersfield who faced some health issue regarding the respiratory difficulties and also the
S: the people who have family members
S: who's dealing with breathing issues. So
S: just wanted to know how this air quality issue impact our people in Bakersfield.
S: And also I just wanted to know that. You know all you know. The difficulties make people, you know, feel bond each other because they all together experience the same thing right? Like, you know, hurricane
S: in Florida or New Orleans. Actually, the
S: they feel connected with rebuilding their community from their common channel challenges.
S: So
S: just wanted to know the genuine experiences and your thoughts. How air, bad air quality in Bakersfield impact our employees
S: in both way, positive and negative way.
S: So, sunghyun. Can you please start with the 1st question.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Okay? So the 1st question is about your employment and daily life. So can you tell us about your current role in your job?
P17: I'm a case manager, and
P17: I find a veteran that we classify as homeless.
P17: and we get them in the end we get them a job, but also with that we remove any barriers they have, so if they don't have a house, we look at putting them in a shelter or getting them their own apartment.
P17: If they need food. We have like ways to give them food, clothing.
P17: Also, we've been doing mock interviews lately, so I've been having. It's been really fun for me. So I just like looked up how to give interviews. And so now we've just been given mock interviews to get people over that.
P17: And
P17: it's been a lot of fun fun for me, so it doesn't feel like I'm at work even most days.
S: Oh, okay. So for the mock interview,
S: are you taking a role as a interviewee or interviewer?
P17: I'm the interviewer.
S: Oh, okay, got it. I just want I just, I just thought you and your colleagues, you know, take role, switch your role. And you know it, you know, preparing for the interview.
P17: And I found a lot of interviews I've gone to before this job. They were doing panels. So it's like 3 people rapid fire. So I'll get my 2 coworkers, and we'll just set up a desk and kind of try and intimidate them a little, so that they're more ready.
S: Hmm.
P17: For the real world.
S: Okay. Got it.
P17: And then also resume updating as well. What's been really successful is targeting resumes.
P17: So we really spend a lot of time with each person.
S: Well, so you're mentoring you know, not homeless person, but veterans who who don't have their
S: proper living space. Is that correct?
S: Okay, I think it's a really valuable, you know, work that you are doing, especially in Bakersfield.
P17: There's a lot of, a large population.
P17: I'm like, cause I I found I didn't know how big the population was until I joined. And they're like, we're gonna go here. We'll go here. We'll talk to these people, table these events.
S: So.
P17: Really cool.
S: Do you have the number of the people in Bakersfield you're working with.
P17: Oh, I'm I'm working with, right now, we're talking to about 60 between the 3 of us getting them through, because sometimes people don't want help, and they're very stubborn. So we will set like, anyway, any step in the process. They'll just stop talking to us and leave. And I'm like, Okay, I guess I'll talk to someone else then. So.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Basically, you have to visit the different places right in person as in
Sung Hyoun Hong: that's the really needed job. And can you walk me walk me through a typical day. For you like Include, including both work and the non work activities.
P17: Yes, so sign in check emails. If I have any emails of people with interest, I'll set up an appointment for them to come in.
P17: Then I perform an intake package with them.
P17: And lately I've been going over the policy of the company.
P17: because sometimes I'll find errors or just contradictions, and I'll bring it up to the
P17: A program manager. And they're like
P17: a little surprised because they've had this stuff in place for years. And I'm like I've been there for like 40 days. And I'm like, this is wrong, this is wrong, this training sucks. Stop doing that like, who are you, and I'm like, Oh, I'm new. I just started. I'm P17
P17: so a little policy review, then lunch, and then
P17: at least 2 to 3 times a week I'll go on an outreach
P17: either to CSUB or America's Job Center, or even I went to the [Library name] Library because a lot of the homeless, they use that for
P17: the Internet there, the free Internet.
P17: So I'll go there and just poke around like, Hey, is anyone a veteran need help and just codes.
S: So you're only targeting veterans.
P17: Yes.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Is it more common for you, your client, to visit you, or you visit them.
P17: We visit them our office is downtown hidden kinda unless you put in directions. You're not gonna stumble upon it.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So. The second question is about your personal background. How long have you lived in the San Joaquin Valley in Bakersfield?
Sung Hyoun Hong: of course.
P17: Initially 5 years, and now and and I left for 14, and then I'm back for another 5.
P17: So 10 total.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Okay. So what brought you here?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Past them? Now, what brought you to Bakersfield?
P17: Oh, yeah. Family, the family black hole
P17: anyone else from Bakersfield, like family, just brings them back like you'll make it out. But you eventually came back.
P17: Oh, okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So why did you leave the Bakersfield when you were like?
Sung Hyoun Hong: I forgot the when was it like?
P17: I was 18, as soon as I could.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah.
P17: Yeah, I joined the Navy. I just wanted to get out and see everything
P17: I was like. There has to be more than Bakersfield, so I just joined to get out of there.
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's
Sung Hyoun Hong: interesting. So you probably have a lot of experience inside of Bakersfield  and also the outside of Bakersfield. So how do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley, especially Bakersfield?
P17: I I get to see how crappy it is every few months, because my boys will go visit their mother on the East Coast, and they'll come back, and they'll be like a little sick at first until they get used to the air again.
P17: And I'm like we gotta get out of here. So now I'm looking at places like Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas,
P17: anywhere, because this I think this is the worst air quality in the States.
Sung Hyoun Hong: You've lived in the Bakersfield for quite a while, and also you have experiences
Sung Hyoun Hong: from the outside of Bakersfield has your perspective on the air quality issue in Bakersfield
Sung Hyoun Hong: changed during the time?
P17: I before. I didn't know it was bad. I thought, this is just air, and I think that's what a lot of people might have a problem with, because no one travels a whole lot
P17: out of Bakersfield.
P17: So they just they might not even know there's a problem
P17: but I definitely know there's a problem. And for my kids sake, we gotta get out of here as soon as possible.
P17: That's what the second job is for cause that's commission, home working from home.
P17: So that's going to be my ticket to move out of Bakersfield.
S: Hmm.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So.
S: How old are? How old is your children?
P17: Both boys are 8 and 12.
S: Quite similar to mine. Okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So you probably say your thinking has shifted compared to how you saw in the past. Right? As you said. Of course your views can naturally evolve over time, and you probably have some experiences from your transitions. But was there any specific moment or conversation or event that really
Sung Hyoun Hong: caused the change for your thoughts on the air quality issue in Bakersfield?
P17: I think the only one was seeing my kids getting a little sick
P17: and until they get used to it. But just seeing that like, oh, you came from Super fresh by the coast.
P17: Air! You don't even worry about air. It's not even a concern for anybody there, and they come back, and they like the stifles for the weekend, and then they're fine again. But I notice, and I'm like.
P17: Okay, I gotta do something.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I think, yeah, like, it is very common that people feel pretty okay with themselves. But however, when it comes to the younger one, it's really a big deal.
P17: Yeah, do what you want to me. But not the kids.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Okay, so in what ways does air quality affect your daily life at work and home in Bakersfield?
P17: I the phone gives good alerts on when the quality is extra bad.
P17: so then it'll be
P17: I'll discourage going outside
P17: for the kids like, Hey, let's play oculus or a board. I'll be more involved in their day than them just saying, hey, I'm gonna go ride a bike.
P17: I'm like, Whoa! Let's maybe for a little bit. But like come back soon, and we can do something inside.
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's clever. What kind of behaviors or actions have you taken to deal with the challenges of air quality? Just not just like coming back to the home. The indoors earlier than expected.
P17: I have a little air filter in each room, so that I guess.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So not just you and your family. Have you noticed this impact when you are when others around you like it can be like friends or colleagues, or you know
Sung Hyoun Hong: other folks.
P17: I think people just dismiss like, oh, it's just allergies when they're like sneezing a lot or something when it's really dusty, but they're so accustomed to. Just it's whatever, not a big deal. We've been living with it forever, that they don't really
P17: know know the impact of what's happening.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Pretty much. They get used to the air quality
Sung Hyoun Hong: in Bakersfield. Okay, Gotcha. So
Sung Hyoun Hong: how do you feel about your family's health? From bad air quality. It can be your younger ones, and it can be your spouse or partners, and even the parents.
P17: I just feel like we have to. We have to get out of here.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Is the only way to deal with their.
P17: That's the only way to deal with it. Yep.
P17: Outside of having our own air filters and trying not to go outside too much. It's just like, what's our exit plan?
P17: How do we get to Santa Barbara?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, it's pretty like beyond our control. It is there? Yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: yeah. So the next section of question is about your community connection and identity, especially your shared experience about air quality in the Bakersfield. So have you ever shared? Have you ever shared personal or family concerns or issues related to the air quality with your colleagues at work.
P17: Not at work.
P17: I think, when I was in school, yes, because everyone was very
P17: I think the difference between work and school is. Everyone's like thinking at school, and we all have like
P17: very questioning attitudes and at work. Everyone's like, let's just do this and go home.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Okay, can you share any specific examples that you have experience at your school with your classmates? Or
Sung Hyoun Hong: yes, other students. Right?
P17: Right it was mostly before class like, we'll come in. Everyone's sneezing. Everyone's like, Oh, allergies. We got it. And then, jokingly, everyone's like we gotta get out of here.
P17: I was like, well, we really do. But we're just gonna joke about it for now till we can.
P17: So I guess, making it a joke to cope with it.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Oh, yeah, okay, so not just job. But have you? Have your colleagues shared their personal or family concerns or issues related to air quality, not just allergy, or like more like.
Sung Hyoun Hong: you know, more health problems.
P17: I don't. Mostly the ones that have, like actual, real concern, are the ones with children like like
P17: early asthma development.
P17: And then that's when they really notice when it affects their kids.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So your friends and the other students share their experience about their younger ones. Right?
P17: Right.
P17: Yeah, everyone's okay. Except for the kids. It's like, Alright, I'll deal with this. But.
Sung Hyoun Hong: It so beyond just like development of asthma. Can you share any other examples of when your colleague shared about their experience with their children?
P17: There were some concerns of Valley Fever.
P17: That could be pretty dangerous for younger,
P17: but just Valley Fever and asthma were the big, the only two I can recall.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Do they share any kind of strategy, or like what they can do to deal with those problems?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Do they are also thinking about like access strategy, like moving to the different area in California, or something like that? Or do they have like more specific
P17: And usually I share my strategies like, hey, it's real bad today, probably not going to go out, and I might go sit by my air filter for a while.
P17: But no one shared a strategy that they do.
P17: Oh, okay, I'm I'm hoping when I share they'll do that, too, like.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So the next question is, yeah, okay. Sometimes people feel connected when with others, when facing common challenges, like dealing with air quality. And how did it feel to realize that your colleague will also experience similar challenges with air quality, especially with children, and to have an open conversation about it?
Sung Hyoun Hong: I felt, well, yeah.
P17: I felt pretty alone, I guess, cause no one else really thought of an
P17: exit strategy. Just kind of a this is how it is, we have to live with it, and my thinking is, no, you don't.
P17: You can go wherever you want. There's nothing like we're not in the military anymore. You're not restricted to an area. You can go wherever you want.
P17: And I think no one's thought. No one really thinks that
P17: big. I guess they're just really stuck
P17: like, oh, we just have to deal with the now.
P17: Because of trying to get out of here.
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's a little frustrating.
P17: It is.
S: Yeah. Yup, yeah, I think. I think, P17, your, you know you know.
S: I have. I have a long, you know, years knowing with you. You know you're outgoing person. You want to explore new things. Do you think your personality made you think
S: to resolve those issue by moving out
S: from this, you know Bakersfield to, you know, to resolve this air quality?
P17: Yes, I like to. Problem. Solve a bunch like if there's a problem, I'll think of all kinds of ways to solve it like when I started work. I'm like, hey, I don't like to be micromanaged. Just tell me what the goal is. I'll get to that goal if I don't, then I'll ask for help. So I like to be very creative in my
P17: process, like nothing's off the table when I'm thinking about stuff.
S: And sometimes people are quite depend on
S: on other family members. And also we have family members who is really depend on on us. And I know you have a family here. But does that influence your decision to go out?
S: You know, escape from this, you know county.
P17: Yes. So I have a Japan trip in 2 years set up for my oldest son and me, and I want him to know that there's a whole world out there. He's not stuck to even the United States. So I was trying to open his mind to the whole world as a possibility. So by moving, I want to show them like you could just leave.
S: Hmm! You could.
P17: Always just leave. You can, you can almost do whatever you want.
S: Hmm, too many possibilities out there, so
S: does your parents also, you know, raise you with those kind of perspective to be independent?
P17: I think very independent in the fact of.
P17: They're just like whatever you want to think. I guess. I didn't get too much direction.
S: Hmm, okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: And I think we can skip this question right?
S: Hmm.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So I agree that there is only so much as individual can do with dealing with their quality. But I think efforts at organizational level can be a quite different. So
Sung Hyoun Hong: what steps has your organization or school taken to address air quality issue? It can be like distributing more resources like mask or air purifiers, or it can be like including, like planting tree, more eco-friendly behaviors, or something like that.
P17: I've seen nothing, no actual effort.
P17: Sometimes it'll be, hey? We'll send you an alert on your phone to stay inside, but like,
P17: and then what like?
P17: So I guess it's something. But if the answer is just, don't be in the air, then that's,
P17: they're not doing anything. I've heard radical ideas where people are just sit there and thinking like just cut out a huge chunk
P17: in the valley so the air can flow out.
P17: Oh, my, all right, you're just thinking. If you had God powers, I guess, do it.
P17: But let's get back to reality, and
P17: and no one has any actual solutions. I guess.
S: But you know, at least they can. Adjust your working schedule. So I know your working schedule is quite flexible for meeting a schedule
S: scheduling with, you know, your clients.
S: You know there are some specific day, there are
S: dust everywhere, and we can fill the dust in on our hand. So does your manager or colleague think about, you know, shifting your schedule based on the weather or based on the temperature we are experiencing?
P17: No. Weather, temperature, is never a factor.
P17: It has to be something else.
P17: And they that could not be their fault. You know they don't. They've been living here forever. They don't know better. They're like, oh, it's that's just how it is.
P17: Deal with it.
S: Yes, so I think this the thing is, I also experienced this.
S: Awareness of the the air quality is quite, you know, vary across people. So I'm quite sensitive. But when I talk about this matter with other people,
S: they just some of the people says I don't care about the, you know, valley fever.
S: I remember that you know, the staffing class. You called me that, are we going to have a class on the dusty day?
S: So I just said, it's if if the area is not good, you don't need to come.
S: And after that class I went to the other event, and I met with other professor, and he said,
S: even though I cannot see just, you know, a few feet away.
S: It was that dusty. But he said, It's okay for him. So
S: I also felt lonely because the things I'm concerning, especially for the air or the environmental issue in Bakersfield,
S: those kind of people, you know, make me feel, you know, very sensitive people.
S: and makes me feel that I'm not a normal people.
S: So do you also feel something, those kind of feelings that you're lonely regarding the sensitivity and environmental, you know, issue in Bakersfield.
P17: Absolutely. It feels sometimes I don't even, I don't even want to bring it up, because then
P17: no one else will agree, because no one else usually agrees. They're just like whatever, they just brush it off. So I'm like, alright. Maybe I just won't talk about it.
P17: But now I'm probably missing those opportunities to talk with the people
P17: that also feel it. But no one wants to say it, because now we're not going to feel like we
P17: are normal.
S: Okay. So we talked about the hot weather. But
S: do you think we are less talking about the air quality?
P17: The air quality doesn't get spoken about
P17: almost at all, unless it's like the one super extreme
P17: day a year. But it's always kind of bad.
P17: But no one talks about it until it's like 80 90% bad now.
S: So when the weather, the air quality is bad, I could see very few people wear masks.
S: I'm not, you know. I'm from South Korea. I'm not
S: familiar with the American culture. But do you think taking mask is kind of behavior
S: that is considered as a taboo in this country or this region?
P17: I think it got less taboo. But still, now that we're out of the Covid era,
P17: now, it'll be like you're gonna stick out a lot.
P17: cause no one else is really wearing a mask. So unless everyone's doing it, then no one's doing it.
S: hmm!
S: So wearing mask.
S: So people who want to wear masks.
S: you are thinking you are saying that they might feel some pressure to not take the mask.
P17: Right,
P17: like everyone's gonna point at him like, Hey, look at this guy. He's still wearing a mask. Covid's over, calm down, like they don't even know that it's for other stuff. They think
P17: the mask is for Covid only.
S: Hmm!
S: Does that? If the man wear a mask, does that
S: feel like a sign of weakness or.
P17: There's there's a lot of macho dudes that have to be tough out here. So it's like.
P17: you know. I'll sacrifice my health to be cool.
S: It's almost like smoking.
S: Okay, all right.
S: That was a really great point. Valuable point. I think we can use that in our research. Thank you.
P17: Cool.
Sung Hyoun Hong: The relately. P17, would you say you're fairly knowledgeable about their quality issues? Because sometimes you know, the more we understand why it is dangerous and serious the more sensitive we become to it. And eventually we want to leave the place.
P17: I wouldn't say I'm more knowledgeable on like what's in the air. I just know it's bad.
S: Hmm.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Cool. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.
P17: Oh, go ahead! Go ahead! Sorry!
Sung Hyoun Hong: So do you think people around you at school and also at the workplace, are also well informed, and they really know a lot about the what is the issues about the air quality problem.
P17: No, not at all.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So.
P17: Like, hey? My phone said, it's bad today.
P17: That's it.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Gotcha. So that's probably
Sung Hyoun Hong: maybe the one of the reason why they are not really talking about their quality issue.
P17: And I think if I knew, like, hey, the quality sucks because this specific
P17: budweiser I, I just remember budweiser, because I saw the the huge factory like because of their output. Now this is in the air. Then I would be like, hey,
P17: why are they doing that? But I think, since now we don't know.
P17: there's no like there's nowhere to send, but not anger.
P17: But there's nowhere to send these negative feelings about there.
P17: so that it just goes to, whatever that's just life.
Sung Hyoun Hong: They really do not much care about,
Sung Hyoun Hong: there's potential negative effect on the air quality issue in the Bakersfield.
S: I I feel like when I feel depressed,
S: always, there is a moment where I could, I feel that I cannot control over many things on my hand.
S: So at those moments I feel depressed.
S: But I think people can also feel depressed, but because they cannot control
S: their environment around their house or their workplace or their family members. They could, you know.
S: they could work hard and get promotion, and they could, you know, buy a large house
S: and go to the good school district that their kids can, you know.
S: have a good teacher and friends, but
S: actually they cannot control their air quality with their effort or their time, or their
S: you know any efforts they can put on. So
S: do you think those kind of feelings that you cannot control your air around you,
S: or your organizatio, or state government cannot control the air quality,
S: Do you think that could make employees feel, you know, depressed on their life
S: over the course of years?
P17: Yeah, feel kinda helpless. Like.
S: Hopeless.
P17: Like, there's definitely people making a profit out of what they're putting into the air to create whatever they're making.
P17: And we just have to,
P17: that's okay.
P17: or it's supposed to be okay.
P17: And even if it's not like, okay to another human to do that legally. So it's like, okay, the government says, this is okay.
P17:  So there's nothing.
P17: No one person can do anything
P17: like, even if I talk to the mayor for 30 min and try and convince her,
P17: what is she gonna do?
S: Hmm, yeah, if you limit activity of
S: of the company who's making a lot of job in Kern county, especially Chevron, or you know,
S: you know, Wonderful company, you know. They put a lot of pesticides on through the air.
P17: And there are some things that are maybe gonna get better, like the electric vehicle initiative to have less and then raising
P17: all the California tax on cars to reduce people to wanting to drive. But that's just
P17: people are just having to just be more poor because they're driving the same, it's just paying more. It's not discouraging anybody. It's just just make, they're just making more money.
S: Hmm, okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, I do agree that people might feel helplessness, because, you know, it's like
Sung Hyoun Hong: getting worse and worse, and three negative thing and nothing improvement. But is there any way that we can find some hope?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Unrealistic?
Sung Hyoun Hong: No?
P17: I think I think the companies can justify what they're doing. Enough
P17: that there's nothing normal civilians could do about it,
P17: like, well, we're within these limits, and if we restrict the limits we'd have to get the government officials to cut back on like their smog vouchers or whatever they're using.
P17: But then that's like, now you're taking money. And then that's gonna get into
P17: powerful people with lots of money, and
P17: they don't like losing it. So.
S: Hmm.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So what? Yeah, for the idle situation? Yeah, that's really yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I feel, yeah, it's very unfortunate. But
Sung Hyoun Hong: in idle situation, what kind of support or initiative do you think your organization could provide to better address air quality to your employees and colleagues?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Is there any like or a specific way that your company can help you to deal with those problems.
P17: I think if they would
P17: remove the stigma of mask like, Hey, everyone, it's this bad. You should wear a mask that way. You see, people? And then it turns from, why are you wearing a mask to why aren't you wearing a mask
P17: like this? They said you should be wearing it.
P17: I think that would help for being out and about.
P17: I don't want to say air purifiers inside, because that's just like a personal choice, and
P17: you can't have. I don't know. I don't know if it's okay to require everyone to have air purifiers in their rooms, but.
S: Hmm.
Sung Hyoun Hong: So.
Sung Hyoun Hong: yeah, if the company makes those kind of effort or something more valuable initiative practices, do you think your
Sung Hyoun Hong: you you might, considering staying within the Bakersfield, rather than relocating.
P17: No, I don't think that's enough.
P17: Because the mask may protect you a little bit, but
P17: I don't want to see my kids riding a bike with a mask and.
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's fair.
S: Yeah. So we are planning to initiate a training program for a certain agriculture company.
S: Awareness of the the bad air quality is important, but not all employees know that because, you know, education level is quite different across people.
S: So I think with training, I think we could possibly elevate the, you know, importance of
S: wearing protecting gear when the air quality is bad, and I think that also make
S: kind of inclusive culture that we respect people who's more sensitive to certain, you know certain issue.
S: Yeah. So I think that was a really valuable
S: you know, voice from you. Thank you very much.
P17: Have you looked at any grants for this?
S: Oh, we got a grant, and,
P17: Great.
S: Yeah, so this is run by a grant.
P17: Okay, awesome. My my world's been opened to the endless amounts of grants out there.
P17: So awesome.
S: All right. So I think. Sung Hyoun, do you have a last question to P17?
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, actually, I have one more question like
Sung Hyoun Hong: regarding that. And in order for people to heard and hope for improvement, what do you think companies like, especially
Sung Hyoun Hong: those contributing to the negative air quality air pollution I mean, need to understand about the hardship people are facing?
P17: I think the companies must know
P17: like they know what they're doing. But as long as it's legal,
P17: then no one's losing sleep, or even people will do terrible things and still go to bed without a worry.
P17: But
P17: I think it just. It would hurt their bottom line to restrict anything, and no one wants to do that.
S: Hmm.
P17: So I think all they can do to look like the good guy still is to now like, hey? Sorry we missed your air up. Here's some masks or other protective gear.
S: Hmm, all right.
S: Okay.
P17: Even if they had the.
P17: If
P17: if you're trying to paint the company as a good guy, they could make it at least seem like they're helping like, hey, we're reducing these emissions because of this like, at least, if it seems like they're doing something, then people will have
P17: hope. I don't know. That's too manipulative just to like, but they can do that.
Sung Hyoun Hong: I think that this is all for our questions.
Sung Hyoun Hong: And thank you, P17, for being here, and it was very helpful and valuable. I really appreciate your thoughts and experiences.
S: Okay.
P17: Thank you for having me.
S: Yeah, thank you.
S: And P17, I will. Can you send me your personal email,
S: other than [email], so that I can compensate. So for this interview, we provide $20 compensation.
P17: Okay.
S: And oh, let me stop the recording.
