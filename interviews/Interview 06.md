P6: For the air quality that's been most difficult living here with the air quality.
P6: And it's actually bad during wildfire season.
P6: Yeah, and even on regular days. Yeah, it's yeah. It's it's, it's, it's quite bad. And it's actually very concerning, even as a parent.
C: And in what way does the air quality affect your daily life at work and at home?
P6: Yeah, it actually affects my life in many way. At work
P6: being outdoor all day. Means I'm actually constantly exposed. I suppose, and some days I come home. Feeling physically drained
P6: just from breathing in the air. Yeah. And at home
P6: we've had to limit outdoor activities for
P6: for my kids. Yeah, because the air quality alerts are so high. Yeah.
P6: And of course, is.
C: Yeah. Please- please.
P6: It was his choice.
C: Okay, have you noticed its impact on others around you?
P6: Sure I've noticed the impact on my others, especially my coworkers.
P6: and some of them they complain about frequent headaches
P6: and kind of respiratory issues. Yeah. And some even take leave. They take sick days off. Yeah, doing during such period.
C: How do concerns about your family's health? Influence your feelings like the air quality, especially.
P6: Yeah, it's just my kid that I'm so worried about, because he's too young
P6: and to worry. How prolonged exposure to this kind of air might actually affect his development. Yeah. And it's something that my wife and I talk about often and actually a major factor
P6: in whether we see ourselves staying here long, term or not.
C: Do you think experiencing air pollution with others? Strengthen your sense of connectedness in your organization, or friends or family.
P6: Sure, of course. those sometimes when we have bad air quality. We me, my my neighbors and I with my coworkers once in a while. We exchange tips on how to stay safe during this period, and we also share resources on how to just be safe.
P6: So we don't get out. Yeah. During this period.
C: And how do you feel when others share similar experience related to air pollution?
P6: I I just feel this kind of stronger connections with him. I feel
P6: pity. And I just I feel sad for them. Yeah, when people share their experience with me.
C: So when you share the air quality problem with your colleagues like so sometimes people feel a strong bond, right? So whenever you face the common challenges, so do you feel the same when you share about the air quality.
P6: Yeah. Yes, sure. I feel the same. Yeah, because when I'm sharing information with others about similar things. It's it's it's kind of unites us in in some ways.
P6: Yeah, so and has also made me feel it's kind of empathic toward others in the community. Yeah.
C: How has this sense of bond affected your thoughts, feelings, or actions towards your organization?
P6: Yeah, sure, this is a very good question. So for this, I've always been more vocal. Yeah, and about fighting for better protection. Yeah, like Max in in our workplace for the employees. I I try to make sure everyone has a Max on to like to to like prevent us from being out. Yeah, by the bad air quality.
C: Have you shared your personal or family vulnerable vulnerabilities related to the air quality with your colleagues.
P6: Yes, once in a while, I think. Yes, I've shared this with a few colleagues, and the responses was quite mixed.
C: So.
P6: Supportive. Yeah, when I shared my experience, and also when I was talking about my experience, some shared similar stories.
P6: and there were some that were not really interested. They were just about themselves.
P6: Yeah. And this actually made me to be more selective, to whom I want to open up to yeah, when talking about family issues. And so.
C: Okay. So what actions? If any, you have taken to deal with the challenges of air quality.
P6: Oh, at home.
P6: My wife and I. We've invested in air purifiers, and we do seal our windows to reduce indoor pollution.
P6: And also we try to make conscious efforts to shake air quality apps
P6: before planning any outdoor activities.
P6: And yeah.
C: How do those around you cope with bad air, quality.
P6: Can you come again.
C: How do people around you cope up with bad air quality.
P6: Yeah, of course. They do cope with air quality, too. We. They try to use a purifiers. And I've also taught them on how to use apps to check the level of air quality before moving out of their house and to. And they also use their marks. Yeah, their face masks always.
C: So do you check the before you step out of the house. Often do you check the map or not map like an app, or any air air quality map that is the air quality, good or not.
P6: Yeah, of course, I do.
C: Okay?
C: How is your organization helping employees to overcome air quality issues?
P6: My organization has actually tried. They've taken minimal steps to help us address equality. And yeah, they tried. They've provided marks during wildfire season.
P6: Yeah. And but for what I'm seeing.
P6: I don't think they have long term strategy to help or scope. Yeah. So I just feel like, they are trying a lot. Yeah, they've taken efforts, but it might not really be enough. Yeah.
C: So you, said the. You don't see it long times. But what do you think about the organization's action?
P6: Yeah. Oh, yes, I feel they've they've they've taken a good step. But yeah, they've taken a good step by providing us with
P6: with some coping strategies like, Max, yeah. And they've actually taught us on, on how to manage ourselves during this period, like having some classes on how to manage ourselves. So I feel they've done
P6: what they can to control it at the moment. But, it's man. It's not really enough for me. Yeah.
C: And how long have you been in San Jokan Valley?
P6: I've been here for over 6 years. Yeah.
C: Okay, okay, so has the support from your organization changed your perspective in air quality issues.
P6: Of course. Yeah, sure.
C: Then
P6: Awesome.
P6: Do you want me to explain or.
C: Yes, yes.
P6: Okay, so about impact of actions
P6: for my workplace, I feel that's actually like, change. Yeah, my perspective, because I feel we've tried enough.
P6: Yeah, by providing us with what they feel is actually okay for us at the moment. Yeah. But but I I just feel
P6: air pollution is more of a systemic issue.
P6: Yeah. And it's we. It's it's it's more than what the company can actually do for us.
P6: Yeah, I actually appreciate the small gestures. Yeah, but they don't have a meaningful solution.
P6: Yeah, so I feel the government have to do something about this.
C: Less support from your organization. Strengthen your connection to the organization.
P6: Yeah, sure. Of course, I think it has actually strengthened it. Yeah, because I feel they've had a sense of loyalty to us by by paying for us.
C: So have you ever participated? Or are you aware of any community or organization effort in addressing the air pollution.
P6: No no, it is.
C: So, okay, okay, okay, now, please proceed.
C: So do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area? Long term.
P6: I'm not sure about this.
P6: Yeah. Although. This place is quite affordable. Things are very good and nice for everybody. There is job. Stable job opportunities for everybody. Yeah, compared to other parts of of of the States. Yeah, I just feel the environmental challenges is a major drop back.
P6: Yeah, because the air quality affects my family's health and limits our lifestyle, especially for my side. Yeah, we can't go out to enjoy ourselves for so long. Yeah, so I
P6: I'm not really sure about staying here for so long. Yeah.
C: Is the air quality seasonal, like? What? What time does it affect? The most.
P6: It actually affects most doing white fire. And I, I feel actually, it happens more in doing summer for me. Yeah.
P6: So yeah.
C: So if imagine the air quality has significantly improved.
C: how do you think that would affect your life and connection to the community?
P6: Yeah, it will actually make it more easier for us. Yeah, we'll spend more time outdoor as a family. And yes, and we will be very happy staying here.
P6: Yes, I will have a positive outlook about this place. Yeah, if you have a cleaner air, it will make it more more really fine. Yeah, staying here
P6: and make it very healthy for for us as a family.
C: What potential factors can make people leave Sagnakin Valley.
P6: Yeah, for these. I I feel when there are better opportunities in other regions.
P6: the African environment a few people might leave
P6: and if there is no progress, from our local governments or local authorities to help improve this situation, I feel people might also leave.
P6: and also, if people are having health issues cause of this air pollution. Yeah, people might want to live to a better place to avoid complications.
C: What potential factors can make people stay back in Santa Quin Valley.
P6: Yeah. For this, I feel if there is cleaner air for everybody.
P6: Yeah. And they are actually improvements in equality.
P6: Yeah. And yeah, and I feel if there are increased access to health care resources about issues with air air quality. Yeah, I feel people want to stay more.
C: Okay, so that's the questions from us. Is there anything else that you would like to share about your experience with air quality or community connections in the San Jokan Valley that we haven't discussed.
P6: Yeah, not really. I think we've discussed most of everything. But I want to just tell you that for this issue to be solved. I feel we should, of course, talk to the local government, and probably Ngos, you should please advocate. Yeah, and let them know that we are actually like, really struggling with this. Yeah, so they should please try to make things more easier about the air quality. Yeah, because I feel
P6: if you are. Ld, we want to stay here. Yeah. But if you are having issues with our health, we might want to leave.
C: Okay, okay, so that's the that's it from our end. And I will talk to my professor, and you will get the gift card soon, maybe within 48 h, and thank you for taking your time and joining us. Have a good day.
P6: Yeah, sure. Thank you. Is that all.
C: Yeah, I hate that song.
