## Transcript
S: I just wanted to introduce my research about air quality in Bakersfield. And actually, that applies to my, you know, personal experiences. When I first came to Bakersfield in 2022
S: from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
S: so my daughter had asthma right away. Her age was like, you know, only 3 months.
P16: Oh!
S: Yeah. So it impacted a lot because it was during August, when the heat is really high
S: and because of the high level of ozone. It was not easy to, you know. Open the window as well.
P16: Absolutely.
S: Yeah. So that's why I embarked on this project, reflecting how air quality in Bakersfield influences work and life experiences, and employees in our neighborhood.
S: So yeah, just wanted to. But I cannot reflect my own experiences in my research, because then
S: it's not research, because it loses objectivity.
S: But that's why I'm conducting a research and thanks for, you know, helping our research.
P16: I have a big input on that, because I have. I live actually more in the central valley where the dust bowl is
P16: higher level than what it is in Bakersfield. Because I'm more in the hole, I'm in Porterville. So I have a lot of input in that. As a matter of fact, my husband, right now today, just yesterday, had to go get a new, stronger inhaler because he was weed-eating, and the dust bowl is so traumatic that his lungs expanded,
P16: so absolutely have a big input. I have a farm, a ranch with numerous trees. I have 80-year-old trees on my ranch, and still, the ozone is impacted so strong.
P16: Not even the trees are helping, and I have 80-year-old trees. I have 40-foot trees all the way around my property, and still the high impact of the ozones is is hurting my husband's health.
S: Okay, I I thought the ozone level only impact mammals, including, you know, human who breathe the air. But.
P16: Yes.
S: Quite shocking that it, you know, hurts plants as well.
P16: Yeah. So yeah, he, they say that the more plants and the more trees that you have that it should be able to your air quality should be better. So, we have all these huge trees around us, and the air quality is not better because it is so bad right now in here, in the valley.
S: Yeah.
P16: So.
S: Yeah, so I'm quite looking forward to your, you know experiences because I believe that this research will impact our policymakers and also our you know, managers in the company who who is leading our employees.
S: And that will influence our current, you know.
S: community, and also my hope is that this research can make our neighborhood a better place.
S: We can live with better, you know, life conditions.
P16: Absolutely.
S: Yeah. So so let's dive in step by step.
P16: Okay. Okay.
S: And this is a structured interview and
P16: I think
S: You could also do some you know, some research while you are doing a Phd program.
P16: Yep.
S: The reason why we called this a semi-structured interview, is that we have a structure, but based on your experiences and responses, we will deviate some to have a deeper, you know, share from our respondents.
S: So first we will talk about your current role and responsibility. So can you tell us about your current role in your job?
P16: Okay, my current role. I work at a production plant where obviously, it's important because we do. We have milk. We work for we do all the production with our obviously the cows, because we are a cheese and can I name the place or no?
S: Okay.
S: Not the precise, you know. Place.
P16: Okay, okay, so a production. So we are in production of your milk and your cheese for the valley. It is the biggest production plant. So obviously, our cows are very important because we have to monitor their health so that we can have the best production of milk, cheese, all anything dairy.
S: So I,
S: I believe you are the office worker. But does your work require physical presence in the the farm or
S: do you have any flexibility in working indoors or outdoors?
P16: Actually, I am the part of the head of the security. So I actually have a big part of it. I am throughout the whole production plant. Because we have to make sure. The quality control because of the cleanliness. All of the when we have to make sure that no access of outside can come in. We are fully dressed in
P16: PPE all the way from head to toe to enter the production plant to make sure that there are no bioproducts
P16: particles that go in. So yeah, so I am. I am in all of the department, all of the buildings.
S: Oh, okay.
S: That's quite interesting. So can you walk us through a typical day for you, including both work and nonwork activities?
P16: Okay. A typical day for me is obviously, you know, just getting up getting ready for work. I drive 42 miles to work. So I'm always in the elements I get to work I get. I am a Site Supervisor. So I make sure that all of my guards are briefed on what the day's activities are going to be, some in which we have, we have to. We have people that come in to do additional inspections to make sure that everything is
P16: at to the highest of quality for the company. And so once we do our briefing, then I assign my guards a position where they're gonna go. We have 4 different posts. Each one of them is always briefed on anything that from the previous shift. Say that we had somebody try to come on-site and breach the site. We had to call PD. Or whatever we had to do. We make sure that everybody is always briefed and up to date
P16: on that so the site is very secure for any foreign foreign
P16: on people. Anybody that would have any kind of harm, you know, to just, you know, to disrupt the production force of the
P16: of the produce.
S: So after you complete your work, you will come back to your home and are there any typical routine, you're, you're doing?
P16: Most of the time. Routine is well, we have the farm, so we also have chickens on our farm. So we that's the same thing. We have to make sure that all of our chickens are fed and and our eggs are collected. So we also have that environment. We are in also.
S: Okay, it it feels like, you are living in the ideal. A place I'm dreaming of.
P16: I love it. Yes, I am.
S: And how do you feel about the air quality in San Joaquin Valley? We have briefly talked about it, but I just wanna know your general thought.
P16: I truly believe that we could. It could be improved. 100%. All of my family members are on inhalers right now. I have a little one like you said actually with you, like she was 2 years old, and was on inhalers in and out of the hospital, my niece, and still to this day on inhalers, and her breathing quality is very, very poor.
S: So you are,
S: you're evaluating, evaluating the air quality in our community from the symptoms from your family members.
P16: Absolutely.
S: Okay, does that impact your health?
P16: My health. Yeah, I have had experience where I've had to go for months with the rescue Inhaler just myself. I am 62 years old. So I do, and I think that age becomes a factor.
P16: And and just as the little one like your little one that was younger well, also the seniors. I believe that as becoming seniors, we become more susceptible to breathing problems.
S: Okay, thank you. So
S: I believe you had lived in San Joaquin Valley for a long time. But has your perspective on the air quality issues changed during those years you have lived in San Joaquin Valley.
P16: I truly well, absolutely, because they've worsened, because look at how much of our trees are gone. Look at what they've done. They've taken. They've cut down all of our trees to put houses. So you know, even that slight quality that is was better because we had some of the oxygen from the trees. Now we don't have those anymore. They've all been taken away. More land has been cut down just for housing.
S: Okay, I I felt like, you know, this is my third year living in you know, California.
S: And I felt like there's no trees in Bakersfield. And I thought because that was the the
S: the original. You know condition that Bakersfield has, because I felt like that. Bakersfield is like a desert. But you're just saying that we had a
S: some trees, or maybe some small forest around our city.
P16: We had actual agriculture. We had numerous trees of agricultural trees. A lot of our agricultural trees are being cut down, and to put houses. So that's where I see a lot of the air quality worsening because the trees were helping a little bit. And now we don't have them anymore.
S: Okay, like almond trees are cutting down because they wanted to build houses to earn money.
P16: Yep, that's exactly what's happened.
S: Okay.
S: Looking back, would you say your thinking has shifted compared to how you saw it in the past?
P16: And
P16: I just think, as far as shifting, I just believe I want to be more involved like you, as far as trying to to better our community, because I do know that it has gotten worse, and if I have grandkids my grandkids are not going to. I want to know that their world is going to be better, not worse. So yes, it has shifted towards wanting to do whatever I can to impact that.
S: Because of your grandkid, you are saying that they
S: had initiated your transition of your view on the air quality and what action you need to do.
P16: Absolutely.
S: Okay. Just curious of your view view can change. But were there any specific moment or kind of event that your view had changed.
P16: Again. I think it was the health of the kids again when they started needing inhalers and started needing breathing treatments, nebulizers to be able to breathe when all that came into play. I believe that that's when when the change came.
S: All right.
S: I think we are experiencing the same thing because of our kids. Sunghyoun go ahead.
Sung Hyoun Hong: You mentioned that you think that the air quality issue can be improved in some way, so can I ask you, what makes you think in that way.
P16: I believe that the way it can be improved is replanting some of our vegetation, I mean, stop cutting our trees down, you know. Stop taking what? What impacts our ozone, you know, away from us. I believe that is one way that we could change.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Got it. So such a like things like those kind of collective effort can improve. 
Participant 14: Absolutely
Sung Hyoun Hong: Got it. Thank you.
P16: You're welcome.
S: Yeah. We talked about how our the better air quality can influence our health, and
S: that could influence
S: many domain, including work and the family family. So in what ways do you think the air quality could affect your daily life and
S: daily life at work and home.
P16: Well, definitely, if I'm not able to go to work because I've had an asthma attack or my breathing is so bad, then that affects everything, our family. I'm the family, so I'm the breadwinner. My husband is disabled as of now, so I have become the change of role. So if I can't go to work. We lose our farm, we lose our, we lose everything, and if and sometimes like, I said, my, you know I have to go with the inhaler, because I'm out in the elements.
S: And okay, so so in some days I could see we experienced dust storm.
S: And during this summer we consistently experience high level of ozone level
S: that extended until, like, you know, late night, like 10 or 11 Pm.
S: So what action have you taken to deal with these kind of challenges of air quality.
P16: Oh, my goodness! I have 5 acres of dust out there. So it has been. It has been a challenge. We do the screening. We screen the whole house, you know. Try and keep it out of the house as far as walking into it and dealing with it daily, it's just
P16: we just have to, you know. Wait till we have some kind of health issue and deal with it then, because there's just really nowhere way to get away from it, because there's no, there's no trees, there's nothing around to block that. Years ago we had our vegetation, we had our trees, which would cover, that give us a safe
P16: cover. Well, that cover is being taken away daily.
S: Hmm!
S: I could see that the dust storm
S: the strength of the dust storm is even higher around the suburb area of the Bakersfield, where the you know farmland is not covered from the grass or their crops.
P16: Absolutely.
S: Okay,
S: Have you noticed any impacts of that air quality
S: on your colleagues in your company?
P16: Oh, absolutely! And the sad thing about is they're becoming younger and younger. I talk about seniors, which, because we've been breathing this for years and dealing with the dust and for years, but now I see the younger, my younger colleagues in their thirties, like I said, I'm 62. They're in their thirties, and they're already experiencing this.
P16: And I'm and I ask them, you know, because the call offs. You think about it. In my job. I have a certain number of guards. Well, if one of my guards calls off because they're having a breathing issue, surely it's going to impact. Now we've got overtime coming out. We've got medical insurance that we have to pay, you know, for their health, for their hospitals. Definitely, it impacts our our work, environment.
S: Did you? Had notice any increase of the health insurance of your employees
S: because of the the bad air quality, are you, seeing that increased trend.
P16: Absolutely that would think about not having these extra policies, are now adding these extra policies and increasing their benefits because of it.
S: So health benefit has been increased. by year. Are you saying that.
P16: Absolutely.
S: Because people are, you know, visiting hospital more and more.
P16: Emergency rooms. Yeah.
S: Why did you say emergency room.
P16: Because sometimes there we have one young man. That is yeah, (NAME), he's a little overweight, but he has been taken in an ambulance 4 times this year, because of
P16: not being able to breathe, we have had to have him an ambulance come on site and take him to the emergency hospital
P16: because he hasn't been able. He has had an asthma attack on the site.
S: So yes, definitely, so.
P16: This is 4 times, yeah, 4 times.
S: Happen during the work work hours.
P16: Yes, yes, we've had to call the ambulance to pick him up, and the reason he cannot breathe.
S: So, yeah, so.
P16: And this is while he's doing his patrol. So that means he's walking in the air and going from one patrol, one site to the one post to the next, and that's when he starts losing his oxygen because he's in the elements. And so by the time he gets to the next post we have to call ambulance.
S: And security is really important, because you need to protect your food from the strangers.
P16: Absolutely, absolutely.
S: All right.
P16: Actually most likely our food the whole, you know the whole valley's food, because the company that I work for produces for the whole valley.
P16: So yeah.
S: You're producing a healthy food for the people who want to, who are taking care of their health and their family members. But your own employees,
S: they are not,
S: their health is, you know, attacked by the the weather conditions in Bakersfield.
P16: Yep, yep, in the yeah, in the in the valley. Yep.
S: Okay, have you ever shared personal or family concerns or issues related to air quality with your colleagues?
P16: We talk about all the time. We always talk about what we can do, and if there's any way we can, you know better the air quality. And the answer is, no, right now we don't. We don't. What you're doing is gonna help more than what we can do because we're we're just one or two voices. But now, like you said, that's why this was important for me to be part of it.
P16: To be a voice, because my, the more voices we have together makes a bigger voice than just me and me and one of my colleagues, you know, talking about it this way. Maybe we can have an impact.
S: Thank you. Can you share any examples of when you shared these experiences with your colleagues?
P16: Oh, well, absolutely. When the when the young man got, you know, got sent to the hospital by ambulance, our colleagues, we were like, well, what can we do to make it better, so this won't happen to him again? So that is one example.
S: Okay, got it.
S: I think that's a really good example, and have your colleagues shared their personal or family concerns or issues related to air quality with you.
P16: Yeah, we have another young lady that has a child that now is having to be again on inhalers. And you know, nebulizers, for you to be able to breathe. So yeah, I know that a few of them have mentioned that their youngsters are experienced these kind of breathing issues.
S: So you guys are sharing how you could, you know, reduces those symptoms, or, you know, recommending some good doctor.
P16: Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
S: But when I share those kind of air quality issue some people, especially young students, they don't really care about the air, and some of the people, don't you know, aware of the of the air quality issue, especially
S: the people just came to the you know, our Bakersfield
S: usually international student, or you know, the student who just came to Bakersfield for their education.
S: So I felt a little bit frustrating because they don't you know, share the same concern with me.
S: Did you have similar experiences like me?
P16: Yeah, because we have. We have workers that also come from different areas where it's not such a big concern. The air quality. Isn't that bad for them? And the same thing? Oh, it's not that bad we don't want, you know. We don't want to talk about it. It's not that bad, but then I've also been in the company long enough to where their views have changed the longer they are here.
P16: and I kind of, I don't want to sound skeptic and say, oh, remember, 2 years ago, when you told me it was not a big deal, and then all of a sudden, 2 years later, it's a big deal.
S: Yeah. I remember that when I had a job interview with Bakersfield in 2022 spring, we're right after the rainy season,
S: the the weather was really good. No ozone issue,
S: and nobody talk about the air quality issue.
S: I had like four dinner and lunches with the professors. You name it.
S: They never talk about it but once I started working in CSUB, they talk about valley fever.
P16: Well personal experience. My 21 year old granddaughter at the age of 16 did develop valley fever. So we already have one child in our family, and they said that it was due to the dirt,
P16: that she, my husband, was mowing the lawn, and it is set in our dirt. All of these valley fevers and issues are dormant until they're brought up, and when they are, it is a very serious condition.
P16: So it could happen at any time anywhere in the valley.
P16: When they stir up the dirt, that's when the that is how the kid well, that's how our granddaughter got the valley fever.
P16: Oh, yeah.
S: I think that influences all age group.
P16: Yeah.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Regarding that I have one question. If you have a children or younger one, then definitely you may feel more susceptible or vulnerable to the air quality. However, have you ever heard any concerns, or like
Sung Hyoun Hong: some negative experiences from your colleague, who do not have children.
P16: Well, yes, because then they have their their parents. So then we go into not only children's age, then we have their elder parents, where they're caring for that are dealing with the breathing. So it goes from dealing with the the younger kids, you know, that have kids, and then going into the ones that are caring for their parents. So it's with all age groups.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Thought, so.
S: Yeah, yeah, I think you mentioned a really important point.
S: It
S: any age group is not safe because they are related to their youngster, or their parents, or even themselves.
P16: Absolutely.
S: And
S: alright now we would like to talk about the silver line. I I don't want us to be in a despair because of the air quality. I feel that there could be some positive influence from the current challenges, because we are all, you know, experiencing the same
S: things, even though we are rich, or you know, poor or older or younger, we all experience the same challenges.
S: So sometimes people feel connected with others when facing common challenges, like dealing with the air quality like us. So how did it feel to realize that your colleagues are also challenging, experiencing the similar challenges with the air quality and have an open conversation about it.
P16: I felt like for me. I felt like it was necessary.
P16: There is always a need, and that to bring it to light is always important, and for me it's necessary to have these conversations. I feel for my community and for my coworkers, and I am not going to, as they say, keep my mouth shut, because if there's something that that I can do to influence better health for them, I'm going to do it.
S: Hmm! You're saying that it is necessary. Is it related to some responsibility that we are having with their our family member.
P16: Responsibility, yes, not only with our family, maybe, but with our community in general. Our neighbors are, as you mentioned in the beginning, our neighbors, our community. It is, there is a responsibility.
S: So if they feel hurt from the air quality, do you also feel
S: the similar, you know emotional, you know challenges like them.
P16: Absolutely.
S: Okay,
S: Do you think that your own experiences make, you know, increase of your sensitivity
S: to feel the you know challenges of your people around you.
P16: Well, absolutely they do. They do influence it, but only because the influences is important, and it is a must, so that I do not want any of my colleagues, or coworkers, or family, or friends to go through what I've gone through with our health issues. As I said before, if there's a way that we can
P16: help to find a resource that benefits them, then absolutely.
S: So you're believing that not only you know, improving our environment, but also
S: you know, letting our friends know how to deal with the current challenges is also important.
P16: Yes, absolutely. It's important.
S: Okay?
S: And do you think that sharing your experiences with air pollution has helped you feel more connected to others in your organization or community?
P16: Yeah, it has. It has, because I can listen to some of their experiences also, and maybe benefit me in some way and help with my situation. So yes.
S: But can you share any specific examples or moments when you've felt this sense of connection with others
S: especially shared, or talk about this matter?
P16: Well, we did we did. Well, I did talk to the young man that we had say in ambulance, and he did say that
P16: he wishes that there was something that we could do to help.
P16: Maybe
P16: There's no medication or anything we can do, but maybe shorten shorten the patrols for people with with breathing issues. There is always a way that we, a workaround, and that was important with him, because we could. We figured out a way to shorten his patrol for a workaround, so he wouldn't be in the air as much as someone with a healthy breathing system.
S: So like.
S: I remember that, like last semester during the suicide week, I could barely see the
S: the the front because of the heavy dust wind.
S: And do you make your workers flexible on the petrol frequency or time due to the weather condition.
P16: We can.
P16: We can. We can if need be. I am the supervisor, so I can do the patrols on my golf cart, which is quicker for me, and we can eliminate those patrols for that time.
P16: When the dust, when this we had a severe, I actually have a video that you might want to use. I have the last severe winds, dust storm that we had. We actually had to Larry County shut down. We ended up with a the alarms went off for the emergency alarms went off. The dust storm was so bad that we had a lockdown.
P16: So our company had to lock down because we could not. We could not let anybody go into that that dust storm.
P16: So yeah, we do make provisions, if necessary, for the health. If we, if there's a way around it.
S: Great! I think that's a a great help that your workers feel beneficial from your company because your company are really care about their health.
S: Not only not only for their productivity.
P16: Absolutely.
S: It'll be great if you can share that video footage so that I can share it. In my conference with other colleagues.
P16: It's amazing the when you see it. It's it's crazy.
S: Many Americans don't realize the air quality impacts our community because they are not living like you know Bakersfield, or you know, Kern county where the rain is not, where the rain is not frequent.
P16: Yes.
S: Yeah, okay.
P16: Okay.
P16: I'll send you that footage.
S: Okay, thank you. So
S: one more connect question, regarding the connection with your colleagues.
S: So if you feel, connected with your colleague.
S: How does that influence your thoughts related to the air pollution?
S: So that is the process you're talking about the air quality with your colleagues, and you feel connection with them.
S: And again, those connection feelings of connection, how those influence back to your thought about the air air quality in your neighbor.
P16: Well, it makes, be honest with it, it makes me sad that our air quality is so bad that our neighbors are suffering. So the connection is, what can I do to help the air quality for not only me and my family, but for my neighbors? So that's where the impact is for me.
S: So that connections make, you feel like,
S: you wanted to change this issue.
P16: Yes.
S: Okay, I think that's a really important point that I could find from you. Thank you.
S: Now, we would like to talk about your organizational effort how they help
S: your employees facing the air quality issue. And I think your position is will be a really good place where you can share about this issue. So what steps has your organization taken to address the air quality issues? So there could be like, for example, distributing mask or using air purifiers, planting trees, or adjusting work schedules. You talked about adjusting work schedules. But are there any other things?
P16: Yeah, we absolutely provide masks for for the guards. If they need masks, they can. We have the the also the n, 6, 95 s. If necessary. The young man does, if he needs to, with the asthma problems, he will use them again, flexing their their patrols, if necessary, is important, too, to keep him at or keep any of them out of the the elements at that time, when we especially, and then like
P16: calling a lockdown when we had to for the dust storm. So we are definitely proactive where it comes to the safety and the health of our employees.
S: How about planting trees? I think that's a not easy task, because it also needs to. You know, install the pipeline to provide the water.
P16: Right. We have not gone, the company has not gone that far, as is they do plant trees, and they have matter of fact, just in the 4 years I've been back with the company. I've noticed them planting more vegetation around, if not only trees. A lot of bushes, and different different
P16: different vegetation to kind of absorb some of that dust.
S: Okay, thank you. And what are your general thoughts about your company's actions regarding air quality?
S: You could think that they could be more or less, or you could feel satisfied. But
S: or what are your general thought?
P16: Oh, always. We can always do more in every company. We can always do more. It's just again. I do believe that they are. They are
P16: adequate at what they're doing, but always there can be more.
S: Have your concern about the air quality
S: had changed because of your organization's efforts.
P16: Oh, goodness!
S: There could be some training that, you know, educate their employees about the error awareness of the air quality, how they could protect their health due to the air quality. But yeah.
P16: Yeah, that's a good. That is a good point. And I will definitely bring it up. That is a good point on training that I really think that's awesome. I really that's 1 thing I kind of like looked over. So thank you for that. I will. As I said, I am the site supervisor. So I do have somewhat impact to where I can go to the site manager and say, Hey, let's add this to our modules. We have online modules which for our company, which would be really easy just to add a an air quality module.
P16: So yeah, I'll talk to him about that.
S: Okay, thank you.
S: Sung Hyoun, do you have any additional questions regarding this organizational effort?
Sung Hyoun Hong: No.
S: Okay, so we are
S: going towards the end. So consider considering the current air quality issues, do you see yourself continuing to live or work in this area long term.
P16: Yes, I do, I see. Well, I'm definitely committed for the next 3 years, going to going to school in the doctor, 4 years in the doctoral program. But I've been here, I've been here pretty much since I was 12 years old my whole life. My kids and grandkids were born here. So that's why this is so important to me. I do see myself
P16: being here for a lifelong eternity for me and my family, especially now that we just invested in this ranch, which will be inherited to our children and grandchildren.
P16: So I see it as being here for many years.
S: Okay.
S: Since you have a family here, and you have your property and your loved ones here, your you want to invest for your whole life. You just want to change the environment here. Not, you know,
S: keep away from this situation.
P16: Absolutely, and I have an opportunity to move away. And my son just moved to Reno, which is beautiful with the beautiful air quality there lots of vegetation. But this is where we've we plan to live out our lives. And the grandkids don't plan on going anywhere, either. So I definitely am invested in whatever I can do to improve the air quality here.
S: Okay, great. Thank you. And last question, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with air quality and community connection in San Joaquin Valley that we haven't discussed.
P16: Not anything additional, but just to the impact of the necessity to stop cutting down our trees. It is so important that we allow our right now. I just drove out a little bit out of the valley I was, I saw, all laying down walnut trees, hundreds of acres of walnut trees cut down.
P16: And then a sign saying that they were going to a new home development.
P16: So you know, we need to. We're known as the as the Agricultural Belt. San Joaquin Valley is an agriculture belt. We need to stay strong on that.
P16: And but I do see people from LA and other communities where their air quality is worse.
P16: If you look at our population and where our new families are coming from, they're coming from those areas into the San Joaquin Valley, but then that then they're defeating the purpose because they need housing.
P16: So there goes our trees.
S: Okay, this was really helpful. And I think you're the one of the important informants who provided a valuable perspective on our community.
S: So, P16? I just wanted to suggest that it would be great if you can. You know, recommend any of your colleagues.
S: But if you provide email or if you just provide
S: with their name we can contact them. And we would like to provide additional $20 with your recommendation.
P16: Oh, that's not necessary. I'm I am here to help my college. You know that.
S: Yeah. But you know, this is also provided supported by our school, our university, our university provided like $5,000 for conducting this research.
P16: Okay.
S: Yeah, so, yeah.
P16: Definitely. Yeah, I know that I know some of my colleagues. Would they have the same passion for wanting to change our air quality, especially our youngsters that have young, you know, little ones that are now on. You know, asthma treatments because of our air quality, so maybe I can get a couple of them to go ahead and do the interview. Also.
S: Okay, great. So they will also receive $20 from the interview and additional $20 for recommending and providing the email for of their acquaintance
S: who could provide the valuable you know their perspective on air quality.
P16: Absolutely. I will definitely make sure. And I know one of for sure that I can. That would recommend for sure, and I will send you the his email. I will also make sure you got that the footage on the dust storm, because I think that's gonna impact quite a bit to see how
P16: how horrible that was. It was very like I said, we ended up with lockdown.
P16: Yeah.
S: I think that could happen people will not believe if they are live in other States. But you know I have seen that several times.
P16: Yes, so I definitely know, and it was a, you know, a blessing that I got the footage of it, you know, so that that, and I don't know why. I just happened to think oh, maybe I'm going to record this little piece. And now I know why, because it is going to benefit our community to see how this does happen
P16: and have actual visual aid to show it's happening. So I will get you that footage also.
S: Okay, thank you. And.
P16: Okay.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Yeah, I have one last question. And 1st of all, thank you so much for participating in this interview, P16, today. And as name said, I truly learned a lot, and the information you shared was really, really, really helpful, and I was especially moved by your effort and insight and your messages around responsibility and hope
Sung Hyoun Hong: was, I was thoroughly impressed.
P16: I believe it's clear that for.
Sung Hyoun Hong: Things to get better. We need hope, and we all have to take responsibility and make an effort, because no one can do it by alone. Right? So that being said, I'm curious. What do you think about
Sung Hyoun Hong: what do you think we can do to help more? People feel that kind of sense, of hope and the responsibility for change.
Sung Hyoun Hong: It could be something like organizational effort, or it can be something like,
Sung Hyoun Hong: you know, personal experiences or colleagues help or.
P16: I think that Professor had the had the right idea the training. I believe that like we like, he said. Our company has an modules, and I believe that any additional training is important because we don't. We don't have anything like that.
P16: And to provide a additional on environment on air quality. Since we're in it daily, in any any occupation, we are the Central valley. The San Joaquin Valley is in the elements, so that additional training and maybe through your guys effort, you guys can set up a a small visual on the training. If you guys could do that then we can
P16: put it in on our modules, on any organization, any job could be able to implement that in their training.
S: Hmm.
Sung Hyoun Hong: That's sweet. Okay.
S: Yeah, for future. You talk about that training. If we
S: if you provide a small module like, you know, 20 min or 10 min of this small training session and provide to you? Is it possible to include it in your company training?
S: And see how they're
P16: Okay.
S: Okay, how, how your employees view has changed before and after they took the training so that we can also, you know, report in our paper that why training is important.
P16: That sounds good. Definitely. If you guys are able to do that, I can present it to my my organization. And I don't see a problem with them doing that because it is part of our health effort. Also, as I mentioned, our young man, that's, you know, had to be sent to the ambulance, you know, to the hospital by ambulance because of our air quality. So I think that any little module they would be open to share with all employees.
S: Okay, great, thank you. I'll talk about our colleagues and let's get in touch. And since you are joining our Phd program. I just wanted to let you know some benefits from CSUB. I have. I went to conference to Denver, and also Canada with my students,
S: and our school provides $800 every year for the travel.
P16: Okay.
S: And also additional costs are provided by multiple departments from BPA or other graduate program. So this time my student received $2,000 in total for one travel.
S: So you could if you're interested.
P16: Interested. Yeah, I'm definitely interested, not for the finances, because with the with my career, I can take time off. I have plenty of vacation time, too.
P16: So I am able to. I am able to travel so that would be awesome.
S: Yeah. So if you're interested you can collaborate with me with research.

S: I feel the same way. I think this organization is my final you know, final station
S: in my career. So I I'm also vested in this area, too, and also people here around me.
