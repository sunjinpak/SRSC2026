P2: Okay, I would say it has a devastating changes because.
P2: the rate of human activities here.
P2: Harsh some effects on the air which make it worse than quality
P2: and overall in United States, so particularly during the summer
P2: and during the summer months. I would like, I would like to say that the you know, that's really region geography.
P2: climate and agricultural activities contributes to high levels of hair pollutions.
P2: So the quality of air in in this area is very essential.
P2: because it's it's what the human health is being prioritized on.
P2: And to these some necessary precautions when spending times in outdoor activities
P2: should also be monitored. Of course
P2: I will not bluntly say that the air quality is poor.
P2: or it is good, for you know.
P2: It's just a a way of being informed
P2: and alert to follow the local news, to say stay informed about the air quality conditions, because
P2: the effect might be from the agricultural sector, the climate, or the companies there.
P2: because there's nowhere in the United States that the air quality is not poor or might not change.
P2: So in Sanja Green Valley air pollution control is is very, very active.
P2: So that's what I have to say.
K: Okay.
K: So in what ways does the air quality affect your daily life at work and at home, like example if you go outdoor, you know to do some activities with your kids like, what kind of problems, or how does it affect your daily life regarding the air quality ?
P2: The air. The air quality as well poses some dangerous
P2: effect as well as limitation so
P2: in my own way of contributing to the adult activities.
P2: I would like to say that poor air quality in San Jacqueline Valley can impact my daily activities which might result in a respiratory
P2: issues, although I've not been there before. But maybe I've seen some of my colleague have a
P2: and excavate respiratory condition like asthma and brown shields. So
P2: what have it been? What I've experienced so far? Is my outdoor activities.
P2: you know. It has really limits my my hiking, because I emphasize so much in hiking
P2: and sports, especially as I'm a very sensitive individual.
P2: So to this, my health in terms of exercise and fitness has really depreciated
P2: cause. I've not been able to, you know, effectively manage the risks beyond poor air, quality condition.
P2: and and to this, to just avoid the respiratory respiratory issues as well.
K: Okay.
K: So it is an extended version. So can you give an example of how you noticed how the air quality has impacted on family members or friends around you. I know you just gave an example you might want to like. Give a brief explanation of how it is like, how health is influenced, how you feel about that ?
P2: Okay, how I feel about that is, you know.
P2: being an adult and a just say, being an adult, I might be able to manage the the conditions more.
P2: The practical example is, my my kids.
P2: They are. They are not aware
P2: of what is positive or what might be negative. So to this, a typical example is, I can't go to picnic with my children.
P2: and I can't visit some sports centers or anything that will require me to get on
P2: alternative indoor or outdoor activities. So that is a particular example of how it has limit my family.
P2: how will I save my family exploration to the society and environment.
K: Okay.
K: So the next part is regarding community like, do you think experiencing air pollution with others strengths your sense of connectedness in your organization like, has it affected any relationship with your colleagues, or you know, how do you feel when others share similar experiences related to air pollution?
P2: Yeah, I would like to say, in in terms of my colleagues, we don't have any limitation.
P2: because our what I just said previously, is we we all adults, and you are able to manage the rigs as well as the rep the variety. So
P2: it doesn't change any connection. We we're still working okay. And we've been able to adapt to it so far and recently, since it's in summer.
P2: So it doesn't change any condition.
K: Okay.
K: Sometimes people feel a strong bond with others when facing common challenges, like dealing with air quality, you know, living in San Joaquin Valley. So has anyone ever shared with you any experiences? Not not just colleagues like just any friends or any of your neighbors like? How do you feel when you share experiences about air quality with them?
P2: Okay, you know, I feel so.
P2: I feel. So I appreciate the fact that I've been able to recognize because we want to attest to the fact that living in the valley
P2: we've been here for so many years, and we we are wise to decide. Probably make decision. And we have a monitors as well as a website. So you can go check
P2: your your rating.
P2: So I, personally, most of my colleagues do well to, you know. Inform me about that.
P2: I'm always bored to tell them that they are an adult. They have to find ways to fend for themselves.
P2: You know there are some several things that government and government shouldn't do for most individual.
P2: because since we are an adult, we are able to detect. And you know, differentiate from positive and negative.
P2: So to this you you try to come up with strategies that can help you to fit in in a condition that is not permanent.
P2: Air quality is can never be permanent. It's just a swift change, and in response to time.
P2: so I would tell them to just find way. What are the strategies to, you know? Get themselves, have the trouble, and
P2: it's not. It's not a way to complain or an excuse from work or permit.
P2: So it's just for them to develop these strategies, to get back to work, get back to themselves as well.
P2: to protect their families from from respiratory disease.
K: Okay.
K: so how has the sense of bond affected your thoughts and feelings or actions toward your organization? I mean, like the sense of bond, or, like you, have a common topic of air pollution. How has this affected your thoughts and feelings? Does your organization get involved in that part of thing, or if it does not, what kind of actions you would think like the organization should take.
P2: Okay, the bond remains very strong. So we actively involved.
P2: And I believe our organization is working perfectly well to engage in the development strategy.
K: Okay. So I know in previous question you just explained the personal vulnerabilities of you know, family and friends and colleagues. So if so, how was it received, and how did it affect your connection with them?
P2: I I define the connection to be very intimate, because
P2: we are very close to have an open
P2: open conversation without religious, so we don't judge anybody. We only listen.
P2: We listen. We don't judge.
K: Okay.
K: So moving on to the next section. What actions, if any, have you taken to deal with the challenges of air quality?
K: Oh, hello!
P2: Yeah, sorry I missed you. What did you say
K: Totally fine. It's totally fine. I could repeat the question so what actions, if any, have you taken to deal with the challenges of air quality like, how do those around you cope with the bad air quality like your personal challenges and the one around you? How how do you cope with the air quality.
P2: Yeah, personally, you know, I have some strategies and action that I take to just
P2: like to check the air quality indexes. I plan on activities based on air, quality and forecast. I trust much to forecast quality, air quality before I engage in any activities gas for me personally, and I make sure that if I'm going with my family, all of them, they wear a protective gear in form of masks or respirators. When they are outdoors.
P2: then my contribution to the communities. What the community should do as an action is to promote a clean energy and support renewable energy sources like the solar and wind power.
P2: So to these you know. It will encourage a sustainable transportation, promote electric or hybrid vehicles
P2: because of we have a mass movement of public transportation.
P2: And to these they are emitting. And you, you know, yeah, we're emitting some pollutants through the air.
P2: So if you can, the government can help, you know, implement emission, reducing technology to support industries to adopt emission, reduced technologies that's to save visiting some oil producing firm around valley or the water side
P2: just to educate them, and, you know, raise an awareness so
P2: the Government can. The Government has. You know the how I said it is? I have my own tax. Personally, the community have the action, and the government as well has the action too. So we should not override anybody's responsibility because we have a part to play in this.
K: Right. Absolutely. I agree on that. And how is your organization helping employees to overcome air quality issues? What do you think about your organization's actions?
P2: Okay? Oh, my organization action can be limited to, you know, technology in innovations.
P2: So they have to be very intelligent to develop sustainable transportation alternatives.
P2: I think, instead of using public transportation that uses
P2: Oh, emissions they can invest in electric or self-drive driving vehicles.
P2: maybe not now, but in future, you know, on
P2: their in their household they should incorporate green building materials, too.
P2: design on on plan principles, on our energy usage.
K: Okay, so has support, has support from your organization, changed your perspective on air quality issues.
P2: No, it doesn't. I just. I'm a sole
P2: decision on myself as possible.
K: So if
K: does support from an organization, strengthen your connection to the organization? And if it does, in what ways does it strengthen your connection.
P2: Yeah. No. Since we have an open conversation, this
P2: discouraging about our environment or air quality, at least
P2: it has helped to foster the concern about the community as well. Yeah.
K: Right. Okay.
K: So I'll be talking about some future perspective and aspirations on this topic. So do you see yourself continuing to live and work in this area long term. Why or why not?
P2: Yeah, I see myself because you know, I have my, my.
P2: so there are so many reasons to take care so they won't be a
P2: the beer of action. The adverse effects wouldn't be on there.
K: So imagine the air quality significantly improved. How do you think that would affect your life and your connection to the community?
P2: Okay, it really help, you know, to foster more more fun activities, development of parks. And
P2: it will even entails community relaxation
P2: as well as creation of new employment, opportunities.
K: Okay, okay.
K: so what potential factors can make people leave San Joaquin Valley example, lack of advice from friends, personal efforts, corporate support, green initiatives, and what improvements affect at the organizational or country level.
P2: Okay, I just see it as a government engagement.
P2: If time be, the government doesn't engage, I think people will have to change mind to immigrate from there.
K: Hmm, okay, perfect.
K: So what factors can make people stay in San Joaquin Valley?
P2: Alright. Necessary things fixed in place.
P2: active feedback system, either from government or the community leaders setting our principles.
P2: How would I help?
P2: Yeah. Either good usage. What's our usage or industry.
