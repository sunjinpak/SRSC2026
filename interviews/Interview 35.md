# Interview 35

## Transcript
 
[Participant #35]: Sure. So my current role in my job is, I am a senior alumni engagement specialist. My official title at Csu Bakersfield, I handle marketing and communications. That has to do with alumni. I handle like the social media and such. And I also oversee our mentorship program that we.
So those are like my biggest job duties, I would say. I also help with all of our signature events, and everything like that, too.
 
S: Okay, I think many of the posting I could see from the Linkedin is from you. Is it correct?
 
[Participant #35]: If if it's from the Alumni Association page, then yes.
 
S: Yeah, because I follow your guys group. And I could see lots of events going on around alumni.
 
[Participant #35]: Yes, awesome. Well, good. That's a good indicator that I'm doing my job. Well.
 
S: Okay, thank you very much. And that's do you need to be in your office for your work, or do you have some flexibility.
 
[Participant #35]: It's so like. For example, right now I am working from home. but I do go in office like in a in a normal. This is a little bit abnormal, I guess I would say. I just came back from maternity leave in mid May, so I've been mostly telecommuting and I will be through the summer.
For the most part I will be in office again 2 days. Physically my schedule is like switching up next month, so I'll be 2 days at home telecommuting 2 days in office the difficult part is because I'm a nursing mother is. I will have to go outdoors, and I will have to go find a lactation room to
Do my pumping when I 1st joined Cscb I had just had my 1st daughter and I it was kind of the same thing I I nursed for a year with her, and I had to go outdoors in the summer, and it was. It wasn't that long of a walk, but gosh! It was, it felt, excruciating.
 
S: How far from fine your office and lactation room.
 
[Participant #35]: Gosh! It's a great question. I'm horrible with distance. So we are in administration West, next to Provost and the lactation room that I usually use is in that old dorm building that's probably like closest to that parking lot out there.
Yes, and it's horrible as far as like insulation. So it's like. I'm outside and it's hot. So the walk over there is really hot and icky. And then I get into the lactation room and it's horribly insulated, and like the air is just stale, because hardly anyone ever goes in there and uses it.
 
S: Oh, my gosh! So providing lacation room is required by the State. But I I know that even State government. They don't provide. Provide a quality, you know, lactation room, but.
 
[Participant #35]: Right.
 
S: We need to improve that as well. I'm work family researcher. So I knew a lot about it. And I will need to talk about that with Provost.
 
[Participant #35]: Oh, yes, that would be awesome and you know, I think. I don't know exactly like what the policies are, as far as who oversees it now. But I always say, if if it's something that has to do with women, it should probably be up to women to design it, or decorate it, or.
 
S: Of course, of course.
 
[Participant #35]: Whatever. Yes, we know what we need in a room like that.
 
S: Okay, yeah. I think I should also contact with our union organization about it, because they're also care about our well-being. Okay? But that's a side, you know, discussion. But I would like to talk about it more later. You know this.
And can you walk us through a typical day for you, including your working hours and after work.
 
[Participant #35]: So that's a great question.
I would say, like my typical day is I mean my it. It is a little bit diverse. If we have like an event, then sometimes it can be a lot of like. So I'll be in the office. I'm I'm at the computer a lot since I handle the marketing and communications. And I'm constantly like, either on the phone or on the computer doing, you know, like the social media or blasting out emails. So that's like a big part of my job is being indoors, actually have a fan inside that's pointed directly at me so that I can stay as cool as possible. Our building is really old.
Things are constantly like shorting out and then like on, you know, if we have an event. Then I'm probably running around from one side of campus to another wherever the event like, if it's an on campus event wherever it's located, so I can spend a significant amount of time outdoors on days like that.
And then, usually, once I'm home, I'm home. I stay inside because I also am a student at the university. and so when I get home, it's like my time to spend with family and my time to do homework and things like that. But prior to maternity leave, I was taking spin classes regularly at a cycling studio close to my house. So a lot of the time I would go and do that as well. I haven't returned quite yet, but.
It's harder with 2. It's harder to make that time. Now that I have 2 children.
 
S: I totally understand, because I have 3, and my wife and I are also dual earning couple. So we need to get through together.
 
[Participant #35]: Yes, something my husband and I did do is we decided to invest in like a little gym in our garage and we got a swamp cooler to try to keep it cool. So our thought is, if it's too difficult for us to actually physically leave the house with the kids, you know, we at least have access to like exercise equipment in the garage, except I'm like, I don't wanna work out in the garage. In the summer it sounds atrocious, but.
 
S: Yeah, sometimes because of the kids, we cannot go outside. And sometimes my home feel like a cell, because there's no choice for us.
 
[Participant #35]: Sometimes we do take family walks, though. Which are probably gonna decrease now that it's gotten pretty hot.
 
S: Yeah. So how long have you lived in San Joaquin valley?
 
[Participant #35]: So I was born and raised in Bakersfield, and I have lived here my entire life.
 
S: Oh, okay, wow! So how do you feel about the air quality here?
 
[Participant #35]: Gosh! I think I remember reading an article, and I don't remember who it was by, but I remember it said something like the air quality here in Kern like takes like I don't know I could be making up a number, but like 7 years off your life, or something like that. 
Which I kind of believe the air quality is really not that great here? I mean. if you check your weather, app a lot of the times. It's gonna tell you that the air quality index is poor. Don't go outside. You get lots of warnings. I grew up with asthma was born with it. So I think I've had an especially difficult time.
Being in this air quality as a young kid, I spent a lot of time on a neb, a nebulizer growing up. It's something that you know. I can remember so easily, because of all the times I had to sit there and do those breathing treatments, you know, because my asthma just did not get along with this air quality. And my asthma got it. Did you know it lessened as I got older? And I did play competitive sports all through high school, and I played tennis. So it's outdoors. So I think
I probably just kind of adapted a little bit. I still have asthma. I still use an inhaler and everything, and I mean I try to avoid being outdoors as much as I can when the air quality is poor.
 
S: so you said, you check air quality index from your phone. Do you? Have you ever thought some discrepancy between Aqi, that index, and your own perception about air, quality.
 
[Participant #35]: Oh, totally. Because I mean, you can have an air quality index. And it's gonna tell you, you know, it's poor, or it's okay to go out. But if you have asthma like I do you know the way that I experience bad air quality is going to be different than someone who does not have asthma. For example, I also had valley fever for a while, and I feel like that was something that came up in air quality. That's an issue throughout, I think San Joaquin Valley, and I think they just started noticing cases somewhat recently in Arizona. But other than that, it's been focused here, and I'm pretty sure that my dad got it, too. We used to do outdoor walks as a family, my my parents and I, you know, and I think that at that time that and that was years ago. It was like in 2,012 at that time we would do our outdoor walks. We were. We would walk in a neighborhood that wasn't developed quite yet, and there was a lot of stirring of, you know, the dirt and and all of that and I think that just contributed to the bad air quality it contributed to us, you know, getting valley fever and things like that. So yeah, the air quality here. I mean, for lack of a better word. It sucks.
 
S: You lived in San Joaquin Valley for your entire life during those time has your perspective on air quality issues has been changed.
 
[Participant #35]: No, I would say that I've always kind of felt the same way about the air quality. Just like the knowledge that it's not very good here. I mean, I've had asthma my whole life, too, even though it's lessened.
I would say that probably I've always kind of had a negative perception of the air quality here, and it's like especially noticeable whenever I've been like out of town, especially like, for, you know, a longer period. And there's definitely like a significant difference in I don't know, almost like my breathability of the air. And it's so weird because it's like. you know. Here, you know, with with the way that the air is, and I think, like current. We have so many different. I guess we have a lot of diverse like plant life, and such that kind of contributes to the air quality like the pollen and the air, and and everything like that. Actually did an allergy panel that reminded me. And my doctor is like, Oh, you're basically allergic to everything in current. I'm like, that's fantastic.
you know, like, thanks for letting me know. But yeah, the air quality. There's a difference when I'm when I'm in a different place. Like, for example, central coast like. It's so much easier to breathe out there. My nose feels clear if that makes sense like my sinuses, aren't, you know, clogged, or anything like that like I feel like I can actually be breathe through my nose.
When I'm here I feel like I'm constantly breathing through my mouth because the sinuses are clogged.
 
S: So you said your view on air quality was quite consistent around a negative, you know perspective. But were there any specific moment or event or conversation that really cause changes in your thought about air quality in Bakersfield. You said you had went through valley fever. I know it's quite a, you know, risky situation for some people, but just curious.
 
[Participant #35]: I think, I feel like I always grew up knowing the air quality was poor because my parents talked about it a lot. They're both from other areas. Originally, like my mom was born in Texas, and my father was actually born in Canada and then lived a lot of his childhood in Chicago and San Jose. So I'm coming here like in comparing, I think, their previous experiences.
You know that awareness that the air quality here was definitely, you know, different than what they experienced growing up.I definitely grew up with that awareness because you know of those conversations from my parents, and I think, too, in my own awareness, you know, from the asthma, and how I would experience, you know, having to be on the nebulizer and those breathing treatments, you know. When the air quality was too bad, and it, you know, made my asthma flare, and then with valley fever. I didn't have it as bad as my my father did, thankfully, but you know he was in, I think, intensive care for quite some time, and  It was really a horrible and traumatic experience for us. We didn't think he was gonna make it.
It was so scary, and I can't imagine what it would have been like to lose him at that time. but you know even he was scared, you know, and it's so. It's strange to see. You know your father, who's.
you know, has more of these like masculine traits, and you know, like toughness and stuff, and it's so hard to see when they're in pain, because, you know, it's not the norm, you know. My father's like a very old school Greek, you know, so I think you know, he's not one who typically shows that type of emotion. So it was a very scary time for us. Thankfully he recovered. But I mean in talks with him. He's told me like his lungs have never felt the same. He's had consistent like breathing and difficulty. Since that time.
 
S: What after that? You know, experiences. I think it was a really scary moment. But have your, you know, daily habit, or your responses to the heavy wind?
Did those kind of experiences change your behaviors.
 
[Participant #35]: You know what? That's a great question. I would have to say that I think I was a lot more conscientious. I think, when you're young, because I was so young at that time, you know, I was 18, which to me is so young when I look back, even though I'm not too old, but you know I feel like at that age you feel almost invincible, right? You know you have this like youthful almost like a disregard, you know, for rules and all that and such. You know, you feel like you're on top of the world at that age and like, nothing can impact you. And then sometimes you get like a rude, awakening kind of the way that I did with my my father. You know, getting so sick. and I think it just made me a lot more conscientious of be more aware of when there were bad air quality days. And the the troublesome thing is like, I know, with at least valley fever like once you have it. They say it never goes away. It goes dormant. So it wasn't like I could re catch valley fever. But you know, still, I think I was a lot more careful and just cognizant of air quality. After that.
 
S: In the daily life. How does air quality affected your work? Productivity.
 
[Participant #35]: I think for the most part, because I'm indoors. Thankfully, like, I I do. Okay, I think that. I almost feel slowed down it like a like a lethargic you know, if the air quality is too bad. And I feel like typically like when the air quality is really poor. It's also really hot.
So they kind of coincide. So yeah, I think it just kind of makes me lethargic sometimes. And like, I need to take a break, or I need to make sure that I'm like hydrated and have a gatorade. So I think, like like for example, right now, since I'm nursing to like being hydrated is so important for me. So I feel like I'm drinking like gatorade every single day and keeping full health, I think, but it can be difficult, you know, if I'm having to do anything outdoors or anything like that, I try to avoid it when I can.
 
S: So what? So there's a lots of events. outside of the building as you're working at the in your office. So were there any a day or event that you want to avoid because of the air quality issue? Or were there any event you wanted to schedule? But you can't.
 
[Participant #35]: I think. It's a good question. I can't recall anything specific. but I can say like on days when the air has like on days that have been like really windy, and I swear you could just feel the debris in the air and on days like that. It's more like my behaviors of like kind of rushing to my car, rushing inside the building, you know, trying to basically scurry into safety somehow. So I'm not having to spend any extra time at all outside. you know, on days like that.
 
S: have you ever wanted to use mask during that day, but felt hesitant to wear it because of, you know others around you.
 
[Participant #35]: I don't know if I would feel hesitant because of others around me. Especially like coming from Covid, because it's like there was that time where everyone was wearing, you know, had to wear masks, and I think you know.
people kind of accept it. I think my thing with mask is twofold, because it's like I want to be able to shut out bad air. But then, at the same time wearing the mask gets really hot, and it's also hard to breathe in the mask. So I feel like I I'm in a no win situation.
 
S: Okay. Regarding the air quality. Have you ever noticed that? That? Affected your colleagues around you?
 
[Participant #35]: I want to say that I have seen colleagues get sick from the air quality. Things like that, something that's kind of coming to my mind is, I feel like when the fair is in town. I used to love going to the fair, and I would get sick every single time that I went and I finally just was like, it's not worth it to me anymore. Now that I'm older. To go. But yeah, back to your question. I have seen colleagues, you know, get sick.
From time to time. Just from just being out in this, you know out in this air.
S: So how did you notice that your colleagues are concerned or affected by the air quality.
 
[Participant #35]: Just chit chat like, you know, small talk. How are you doing? And you know, usually my colleagues and I are like, Oh, my gosh! This happened to me, and da da da break room talk.
How comfortable are people in your workplace with discussing air quality issue! I think they're really comfortable. I think I work somewhere where people are, you know, feel safe and expressing a lot of opinions, but they're also you know, mindful of other people, too, that.
 
S: Okay, have you ever wanted to, you know, request air purifier, or you know. or flexibility in your for your work schedule because of the air quality issue to your manager.
 
[Participant #35]: I think there has maybe been a couple of occasions when I've just. I've asked to work from home. Because of like the bad air quality to which you know, my director is really wonderful and and understanding about those things. So she's always been very accommodating, if anything like that comes up as far as like an air purifier. I the most that I've done is I've brought my own personal like
Fan into the office. I didn't even consider an air purifier. I probably should have. I didn't think about it, but I mean we. I have air purifiers here at the house, you know. I feel like they're a must and I think to like I used to have carpet in my house and removing. It was one of the best things I ever did, because I was getting sinus infections like.
Almost once a month, and I think because, like carpet is just so good at trapping like. Everything. Dust, air, anything in the air, you know, that gets brought in. And I was. I used to get sinus infections like crazy. That was that actually had a lot to do, I think, with air quality. Who's me getting those sinus infections.
 
S: I'm curious about your experience when you request for request for working remotely, because of the air quality issue. So can you elaborate more about it? I think that's a unique experiences.
 
[Participant #35]: I wanna say on days that where it's been like too too bad, or like, especially if there's something that's not working in the building. Cause. Like, I said, that building is very old and I think I want to say, like.
there have been issues, I think, like electrical issues in it. So on days like that, you, you know, my director, will even say like, you know, she would be the one to say like, Oh, you know, don't you know, work from home today? Because XY and Z are going on, or whatever. And yeah, but she's pretty great about stuff like that.
 
S: Okay. So those kind of arrangements actually came from your director, not by.
 
[Participant #35]: They can. Yeah, it. It's both. Yeah.
If she. Feels like, you know, she I I really appreciate that she is someone who's like conscientious of those types of things. And she also cares about her team a lot, so she doesn't want, you know, harm to come to us like that.
 
S: I I feel like your boss care about your well-being and your health, and also the other you know, colleagues, how do you feel about when your managers reach out to you and make you know provide more flexibility in your schedule in order to, you know, overcome air quality issue in your office.
 
[Participant #35]: How, how do I feel about it?
 
S: Yeah, about your boss.
 
[Participant #35]: I would say grateful. Just because, you know, I've had experiences with other supervisors who were not so accommodating or not even caring sometimes about their team the way that my current bosses. So it's just like I haven't a deep appreciation and admiration for her. As a leader.
 
S: Have you ever shared your personal or family concerns related to air quality issue with your colleagues, and also your boss?
 
[Participant #35]: I think I have talked to we're pretty open. My team like, I said. You know.
we always talk about like all our ailments, or like a bunch of aging old ladies at this point, you know, even though we're still, I guess, young. But we we do share a lot about like, you know, some of our health issues. And we talk about our experiences together.
 
S: Okay, have your colleagues.
So when you talk about those kind of issue health issue or air quality, you know, complaints with your colleagues. Did that lead to another? You know, course of discussion, that you can talk with your colleagues.
 
[Participant #35]: Not sure, if it necessarily led to another course of discussion. I mean, I think we just kind of chat about different things like that and stuff. And I know. you know, my, my boss is always telling us basically, like, you know, let her know if we need you know anything like, you know, either accommodations or like anything. For example, when I was nursing the 1st round with my 1st daughter, when I let my boss know there wasn't a fan in that room, and the it was like very poorly insulated. She made sure to reach out to the person who oversaw that building and and make sure that you know it was a little bit more adequate for me.
So she's she's really good about advocating for us, too.
 
S: I think you're really lucky that you have working with those colleagues. You can share anything with you, and also your boss. How do you build that when you're colleagues? Also understand about your air quality issue.
 
[Participant #35]: I think that they're also really understanding and stuff, too. I think, like. just in general, the people that I work with they're just like a completely different caliber from other people I've worked with, and it's not to put down any of my former colleagues. But the people that I work with are really wonderful and like you said, you know, I I do feel really lucky or blessed, you know, to to be where I'm at to have the boss that I have to have the colleagues that I have. Everyone's really great. So I I feel safe, like, if I have an issue like I feel like I can discuss those things freely with the people around me and but they'll be understanding and supportive, and and such.
 
S: So can you provide some suggestion to the group or team where they cannot discuss about the air quality issues freely or discuss about their health issues of of their family members freely. How could those kind of team can make them, you know, talk freely like your team?
 
[Participant #35]: Oh, gosh! You know it really, I think, has to come from the top as far as, like the organizational culture. Our Vp is the one who kind of set that standard of openness and transparency and you know kindness, I think. And so it's so important for the leadership to set that as an example for everyone else. I I really think that, you know, if you're seeing your leader, set that example and make sure that you know, they're making sure that the organization organizational culture is a positive one. Then you know, it's gonna trickle down to everyone else.
 
S: Okay. So sometimes people feel a sense of connection when they face the common, you know, challenges. So in Bakersfield, no matter how they are rich or poor, age or young. They all face the similar challenges of air quality issue. And we are having. They're all scared about the belly fever, and they're quite knowledgeable about the belly fever. So when you learn that the other people or colleagues share similar environmental concerns, how does that affect you?
 
[Participant #35]: Well, I mean, of course, I have empathy, because you know, I experienced it myself. And so you know, I think it's important to share stories like that with each other just because it is something. It it's. you know, heavily impacted us, for I don't even know how many years. It's been around a long time now, and I think you know, that is something like you said. It is something that a lot of us share is this experience in this bad air quality?
You know. And I think that helps make people more empathetic to each other. If they're struggling with air quality. Like, if they do have asthma like myself, or they do have valley fever or anything like that. I also think it's helpful, because if someone's experiencing something, and maybe they don't necessarily know what's wrong with them. It's helpful, because, you know, like me, like I can tell them like, hey? Maybe you should get checked for valley fever. you know. So I think it can also be really helpful when you share stories like that, because I think it helps them advocate for themselves with their doctors.
 
S: I think that's a really valuable point. I just wanted to talk more about it. So you said that the when people you know face same challenges. People could be more compassionate to each other, and. Do you think that they can understand with another topics other than air quality issue.
 
[Participant #35]: What do you mean?
 
S: Like, you know, people understand when they has an asthma or when they have family members with belly fever. But do you think that those kind of discussion about the air quality issue could make people understand about. You know, the other issues like having baby or having some depression about the work in the workplace, or having some trouble with other colleagues, something like those kind of troubles outside of the air quality.
 
[Participant #35]: Oh, yes, definitely, I think. you know, when you find common ground with someone, and the conversation flows, and you feel like you're in a non judgmental space. I think It becomes easier to share about things that make you feel a little bit more vulnerable.
 
S: Okay, another interesting. You know. Word. I detected from your previous conversation. So you said, non-judgmental, face.
so you think that sharing about air quality, or issue will lead to the non-judgmental phase. Can you elaborate more about it?
 
[Participant #35]: I just think you know. I guess it depends on the people. I think some people are just more judgmental than others. I think everyone can be judgmental. I I know that I have, too.
but I think you know, when you feel like you can share these things in a non judgmental space. It's important. Because, like I said, you know, you'll you might be prompted to share more. If you feel like you're not being judged, and you feel like the person who is you know that you're speaking with is actively listening to you, and you know, being supportive and helpful, and things like that.
 
S: Hmm! Have you ever felt that sharing your vulnerability toward air quality can be weaponized from the other people?
I heard that some people are hesitant to share about the air quality, you know, sensitive from their from the air quality issue, because it could lead to some people who heard that could use that information to, you know. You know, block their career. Success.
 
[Participant #35]: Hmm! I think. That could have probably been a concern. My previous roles where.
Things weren't so positive. But I don't feel that same concern here where I am now. But previously I think you know the team that I used to be a part of it was very
There was always a lot of inner politics, and we all worked in very close proximity to each other. We spent a lot of time outdoors and indoors. For work events, and I think it was very easy to kind of get on each other's nerves. And the leader that we had at that time or that I had at that time was not. She often made things worse instead of better.
 
S: So in that organizational culture, did you feel comfortable to share about the air quality issue or your health related to the air quality issue with others.
 
[Participant #35]: I don't think I shared about the air quality at that time. I was going through a different health issue at that time, and I had shared it with them, so that there would be like more understanding. But even my supervisor at the time kind of threw it in my face.
You know, and was pretty rude and stuff about it, so I don't know that I would be like it like reflecting back. It's it's it wasn't like a safe environment to share about anything. You know.
 
S: Okay, thank you. Have you ever felt isolated, due to the environmental health concerns?
So in order to elaborate more you might think that you might be the only one who's sensitive to the air quality. but not the others. So in that sounds good. Have you felt isolated, or feel lonely.
 
[Participant #35]: I don't think so. I feel like I have this almost perception of like I know so many people with like asthma, or that have who have gotten Valley fever, too, and I think there's almost like a kinship, but also like an assumption of like. Oh, you were born in Kern County. You probably have asthma.
Yeah, I feel like that was a common thing that I've heard from many people like a con, you know, just a common theme. It was almost just like a oh, you're from here. You're born here. You probably have asthma.
 
S: So what kind of emotions come up  when you, when you understand each other, that when you're born in Kern County you will definitely have asthma, and you share that you have the similar symptoms.
 
[Participant #35]: Oh. it's like a almost like a common enemy, except for the enemies, the air quality. But and you can't really do that much about it except for like move. you know, out of Penn County. So I think, yeah, you know, sometimes it lead. You know, it'll lead to conversations like almost like daydreaming about, you know, moving somewhere else.
 
S: Okay? So you said, air quality is like a common enemy for the people in Bakersfield. So when we have a common, you know, enemy actually. people, you know, unite and stay in the same page. Have you ever felt like that?
 
[Participant #35]: Sometimes. I guess, especially with like when valley fever came up. I felt like you know, I've seen a lot of advocacy for awareness and kind of pushes, for you know, breakthroughs on it.
But with the air quality I feel like it's more of like people have almost just become apathetic about it, just because it's always been here. It's never not been that way. And it's almost like this. I guess. Hopeless acceptance of you know it not getting better, and and I don't, and it's hard to say it's hard to see if it can get better. I think that you know, knowing that we're in like a horseshoe. And it all, you know, all this, like horrible air, is just like kind of congregating, and like floating oh, directly over us in turn. You know it's kind of like
The only answer seems to be to move, to get away from it.
 
S: I have been interviewing many people more than 30, and I think the perspective between the people who, as born and raised in Bakersfield and people came from outside of the you know California, or outside of the Bakersfield quite debates. Do you also felt like that?
 
[Participant #35]: Yes, I do and I've heard mixed things. I feel like people who are born and raised here. A lot of them can't wait to get out of here. You know some of them are biting their time to get to college or for a job somewhere else, and they can't wait. I
I've seen so many people say things like best thing I ever did was leave Bakersfield. My gosh, I mean, I know the air quality is bad, but you know it's still, it's still home, in a way, you know, right? Still, my hometown so I do have some loyalty at least here. I don't know if I feel the same as them, and I think, like people who come from other areas. It's been a mixed bag, like, I've heard people say, like, What is this like? This? Air quality is horrible like, why did I leave where I was? And you know my Dad feels like that sometimes.
He came from Canada and Chicago and San Jose, and he's just like. And then I ended up in Bakersfield, and I can't breathe, you know, so he's like very much, you know of that mindset, too. And then I've also met people who like love it here, and I don't. I mean. I love it here in a way, because it's home. But if I wasn't born and raised here I don't know that I'd have that same loyalty.
 
S: Do you think that we have unique culture, that we can differentiate from the other people outside of the Bakersfield.
 
[Participant #35]: Yeah, I do think Bakersfield has a unique culture. It's crazy because I know that we are right behind Oakland, California, as far as population. So that makes us a you know, top 10, right as far as California cities go. So we're huge. We have a, you know, a massive population, and yet Bakersfield, and not even just Bakersfield, but, like current in general. At the same time it still feels so close knit.
You know, and I think, you know people know about the air quality, you know here who are born and raised here. They know about the air quality. A lot of them have asthma. A lot of them have gotten valley fever. So then, you know, you definitely can tell people. You know, if they're not from here, I think.
 
S: It's very funny that you know. Actually, I'm from South Korea and started working at Bakersfield since 2022. And I feel like we could. I feel like we are very close because we are talking about the topic that we all understand. So have you also experienced this kind of feeling that when you talk about this matter you feel quite close to the others.
 
[Participant #35]: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like, it's like, I said, it's like that hometown kinship, right? You know, if you you have a similar experience growing up because you were born and raised here. So if I were to leave Bakersfield and I were to go, you know, run into someone like somewhere else, out out of state, out of the country, you know, somewhere else. And they were like, Hey, I'm from Bakersfield to, you know, there's that automatic like connecting, you know, thread. And then it's like, you're probably gonna talk about the air quality at some point, because you both know it. And I've experienced it. It's something I think, that defines current quite a bit. When you think about you know what is current county known for what is Bakersfield known, for I feel like honestly, and I hate saying it because I wish it wasn't the case. But I think that you know poor air quality is a defining feature attribute of this area.
 
S: okay, it was really interesting discussion. And I think we have found many valuable theme from your valuable perspective. And so this is the end of the interview, and right after that I will send you the gift card and starting fall semester. When the air quality begin to, you know, deteriorate. We will start a weekly survey, so it'll last for 11 weeks. So, and also compensated. So can I contact you again.
 
[Participant #35]: Fine. I could definitely say that it's not like the way that it used to be here it used to be. It would get kind of cool in October and the air wouldn't be so bad. But now it feels like you have to wait until, like the end of November for things to clear up.
 
S: Yes, so it'll be great. You can also, you know, share this opportunity with your friends when we start our survey research.
 
[Participant #35]: Sure. That sounds good.
 
S: Okay, thank you very much for your valuable time, and I hope you have a great day.
 
[Participant #35]: Thank you, you too.
 
S: Thank you. Bye.
