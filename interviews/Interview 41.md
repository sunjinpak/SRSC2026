# Interview 41

## Transcript
 
[Participant #41]: So I'm a biologist. I'm an associate biologist at Stantec, which is actually an engineering consulting company. But I work in the environmental services part of that company. And so that involves me being out in the field, including today, almost every day. So I'm out.
And like Taft, Maricopa lost hills. Sometimes, like I get sent out to Santa Barbara or San Bernardino, and farther than that but mostly just in the central valley.
 
S: Hmm, so does that require your physical presence to your office every day.
 
[Participant #41]: So I don't have to be in my office every day, but generally I have to stop in there once. Maybe if at the very least a couple of times a week to like, pick up supplies, or print out forms, or whatever we have a lot of safety paperwork. So we have to kind of maintain that.
 
S: Okay? So it seems like you have some schedule flexibility in your work, and you have quite a autonomy where and when you can work.
 
[Participant #41]: That's the good part of the job, but it's not always that way. Ideally, yes, but depending on the project I'm working on. Sometimes I have to meet crews out in certain locations or other like coworkers for surveys at a certain time. So it depends on which project I'm working on at the time. So sometimes I have a lot of flexibility, and sometimes I have none. So yeah.
 
S: So, so just to clarify, are you working at the private organization or public organization.
 
[Participant #41]: Private, so stantic. Yeah, I think It's a pretty big corporation. But yeah, it's it's private. From what I understand.
 
S: Okay, so can you walk us through a typical day, including your working hours and outside of your you know, formal working hours.
 
[Participant #41]: Sure like. So today, for example, I basically headed out to the field. I'm working out near Buttonwillow right now. And I'm checking on Kit Box cameras which entails taking my work truck out to the middle of like some agriculture where we had set up about 24, actually about 29 camera stations, and I go and I'm switching out the Sd cards and driving to each station. Make sure it has batteries. It's working and then I head back to the office where I review all of those photos and process the data.
And then basically keep track of that. And my other 2 coworkers are also helping. And I make sure just that their data is also kind of in line and then handle any emergencies that pop up today. Get phone calls. Oh, we have to go out to see this client. Out in Elk Hills. They need an emergency survey for something or other. And kind of coordinating my other coworkers, and seeing who can join me last minute to go do stuff like that and then everything else that comes with that survey.
So sometimes it's scheduled, sometimes it's random stuff that pops up, and then hopefully, I get to come home, and you know, go to a yoga class, eat dinner things like that.
 
S: Hmm! So since you're doing lots of outdoor activity during the work. You know, working hours, do you try to? You know, stay in indoor after your working hours.
 
[Participant #41]: In the summer. Yeah, cause I'm outside, you know, up like to 6 to 8 HA day, sometimes longer and yeah, sometimes I have a normal 8 h day. Sometimes I'm only up there for 4 h, but sometimes I'm out, and you know, in the field for about 12, you know, hours or so. And so when I get home, it's nice to be in air conditioning and stay inside. But you know I'm not always but yeah, I definitely try.
 
S: So how long have you lived in San Joaquin Valley?
 
[Participant #41]: Almost my entire life. I lived in Texas for about 5 years. But other than that, I was born and raised in San Joaquin Valley I lived in Wasco, Bakersfield. So yeah.
 
S: Yeah. Did you live in Texas because of your study?
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah. So actually, when I graduated from Csub, I went to live in on a wildlife sanctuary and wildlife rescue. And I did an apprenticeship there and then I ended up working a couple of different wildlife jobs in Texas. So it's all kind of in that field of study.
 
S: How do you feel about air quality in sound hocking Delhi? I think you can compare with Texas as well.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, I I mean, like, it's always been an issue, like I've had, you know, allergies my entire life, and you know you get bronchitis, or you know, I've had belly fever also recently, and so I have my qualms with the air quality. It's definitely not the best and I think it's definitely highlighted when you know you can go and actually work in other areas where the air quality is better and you feel the difference.
it definitely kind of points out that it's just. It's dusty, especially, you know, when they're harvesting agriculture. It gets very, very, very dusty and very bad, especially in areas where I work. And it's it's extremely noticeable.
 
S: Hmm, so I think you have different worksite you survey. And are there any work site? You think the air quality is? especially good or bad.
 
[Participant #41]: I think it would. I don't know, I guess, like it's definitely dustier where there's a lot of agriculture when they're harvesting but I've also worked on a lot of construction sites where they're supposed to, you know, wet the dirt down to keep any spores from, you know, going everywhere and to protect our quality. But the dirt is so powdery on a lot of construction sites. And this is this is here, this is in Porterville. It's kind of everywhere, Taft. Wherever you want to talk about it, it's still, you know, the dust flies around, and it's still very, very bad. So yeah.
 
S: So there's a source of you know, source that could impact air quality. So one can be dust. One can be pesticides and dust.
And what can I say? Maybe you know, spore. you know, source of the valley fever. So among those sources, which kind of source do you think it's, you know, serious.
 
[Participant #41]: I mean, pesticides are always a concern because we do work along agriculture a lot. I've worked on the high speed rail project, and there were times where we couldn't go and and monitor in certain areas because they had just sprayed the fields. And these are just the landowners that let us know that they sprayed the fields, and they don't always do that. So that's another issue on one of the projects I work on in Buttonwillow as well, there's a lot of pesticide use, and hopefully they'll tell us that's the point of us communicating with them. But they don't need to, and they don't always tell us so it is a big concern.
I don't know which is the worst one. It's not great. I mean, I've had belly fever that's not good. I've had coworkers who had belly fever and and got very, very sick for a very long time. and, you know it keeps popping up. They have more severe cases than I ever had to where they were hospitalized for long periods of time, and they, you know, can't do the things they used to do. And one of them used to work my job. And she can't work this job anymore because she can't really be outside on those poor air quality days. So it heavily affects her.
S: So you live in, you know, San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield for quite a while. Has your perspective on air quality issues changed during those time.
 
[Participant #41]: I don't know if they've changed. I think I've always known that their quality was not good here. I think the worst in the country is what Arvin, or something not too far away.
So we've kind of always known. It's been bad, you know. I know a lot of people growing up who've had asthma and a lot of breathing issues. And and so I'm not sure that it's changed. so much as I've kind of always known that it's not great.
 
S: I lived in Bakersfield since 2022. But everybody is saying that the year of 2022, and 2023 is quite unusual, because we have so many rain.
I could see the rich of the mountain around Bakersfield. Because the air quality was quite good. On the day of we had rain.
But looking back, would you say that? You know the air quality in Bakersfield has been improved or getting worse?
 
[Participant #41]: I would assume it's getting worse, only because there, I don't think there have been very many steps like not noticing any difference, I would assume so just because there haven't been very many steps to improve it. You know, there's, you know, moving to cleaner vehicles and things like that. But a lot of the big producers of, you know bad air quality haven't changed much, and you know, like with the pesticides, the dust. We're only disturbing more ground. And you know, being out in, you know, watching them grade these areas like on a construction site. You can easily see, you know these giant dust devils that pop up, and they're only doing that over open, bare ground. Really, once they hit vegetation, they kind of dissipate. So I, personally, don't think it's gotten better. I definitely noticed, you know, growing up. Oh, it rained today it's going to be so pretty you'd be able to see the mountains around us that are right there that we should always be able to see. But I'm not sure if I've noticed a difference. But I I can only assume that it has not improved.
 
S: So you think that since the people in Bakersfield aren't doing enough, you know actions to improve the air quality issue, do you think that those kind of inaction might, you know, influence your perception about the air quality.
 
[Participant #41]: I think it does. I think it's just that I haven't noticed an improvement. And then with, you know more, I guess what I would call it, is habitat degradation or or development and more infrastructure. And you know all of these different things. I can't imagine that it has improved very much, and and there's only so much that the everyday person can do. It's a lot of the, you know. the energy sector. A lot of the, you know the cars on the road. It's it's kind of everything. So yeah, it might just be my perception of it, and especially doing what I do. But it's I can't imagine that. You know, the everyday person is making that much of an impact. We're doing everything we can. But a lot of like the bigger producers of these issues haven't changed very much.
 
S: Okay, we'll talk more about that in the later section. But I have gave that question because it might be related to the current question, okay, so in what ways do air quality conditions affect your daily activities?
 
[Participant #41]: So working outside a lot. And you know some of these surveys. I'm I'm in almost full oil field gear, where it's, you know steel toes and and fire retardant clothing that are very heavy and very suffocating. And you're, you know. Also you got all your gear with you. It's you notice when it's harder to walk uphill, and sometimes it, you know, it's just a really steep hill, and sometimes it's just a little bit harder to breathe. And I feel like you definitely can tell a difference when the air quality is worse and when it's better. You know, when all those fires happened a few years ago, and the sky was like. Gray, and the sun was just this kind of orange orb that you could barely see. You know, we still had to be out there working, and it was very concerning and not just psychologically. But it could definitely. There's ash in the air. There's literally ash falling down on you, and you had to wear like an N 95 or something, just to kind of protect your own lungs. so answers your question.
 
S: Yeah, I think that really answered my question other than that. Do you have any specific examples that air quote? You know, kind of not critical air quality issue. But just, you know the air quality issue that, could, you know, occur daily could impact your work activities. Not like, you know, the ash from the fire.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, and certain. I mean, on certain project sites. We have to check the Aqi before we go out and survey. It's it's a safety issue for our our personnel. So we if it, the air quality, is too poor, then we could make an argument for safety that we shouldn't be going out there. so I don't know that that I mean it affects productivity and work. But also, once you become aware of that kind of thing it does, you know you're checking in all the time. And it can affect your day to day, or at least my day to day, because I'm outside all the time.
 
S: Yep, yeah. I, like, 10 years ago, I was a engineer, building a factory line in hyundai motors. And we also had a those kind of safety, you know, protocol. But for the work, efficiency, and for to, you know, complete my task early. I occasionally neglect those kind of safety protocols.
 
[Participant #41]: Right.
 
S: So have you ever done that before? So even though Aqi is so high. But you know, you need, you just wanted to finish today.
 
[Participant #41]: Personally, I mean I haven't, and I've I've been lucky in the company I work at now that they kind of have to listen to safety protocols a little more especially the same they set. But I've been at other companies where there was a lot of pressure. We have these, you know, endangered species surveys that we do, and they have to be done by a certain time of year. They have to be done in these conditions by this time by this temperature, and they push you to get them done because you're just kind of going going, trying to knock out as many as you can.
So that I've definitely gotten push back for calling a survey when they wanted us to complete it. But this was when ash was literally falling from the sky. So it was one of those where I was trying to protect my crew, who was uncomfortable with with proceeding with the survey. So it was kind of an ex extreme situation. But I try not to. I think in this line of work everything in this is an emergency, and it's really not. It's the client saying it's an emergency. And I understand, like the fiscal value. And and you know, they gotta make their money and everything, and then every I've just heard. It's an emergency so many times from whatever oil company, energy company whatever. And I understand that. But at a certain point, I'm not going to put myself or someone else at risk for a company that isn't going to. It's they're putting more value on the money than they are on their people, and I'm trying to be the person that's protecting people. If that makes sense. So I try not to. If it's just hot. I'll push myself if it's just this or that, but when it comes to safety I try not to do any of that.
  
S: I think. you said you would like to, you know. You know. Keep the safety protocol. But is that is that because you are in the, you know, manager level. Because and you have much power compared to the other employees.
 
[Participant #41]: I think now, because before I didn't have any say in that, and I didn't have any power, and I was kind of made to do a lot of work in situations where we probably shouldn't have that now that I have that kind of leverage to say no, I definitely use that more for sure, and I try to make sure that people are always comfortable coming to me and saying that they're uncomfortable with something. You know what I mean.
 
S: Okay, I think you are. You are a good manager, because your subordinators wanted to rebuild their, you know concerns to to you.
Have you noticed that the people around you are affected by air, quality.
 
[Participant #41]: So like, I said. Like I I have, you know, friends or or coworkers that have valley fever, and and whether or not you're talking about. You know the fungal spore of belly fever which it does come up a lot in our work. There are a lot of people in my, who are biologists and things like that, who have valley fever because we're outside so much, especially around construction.
But because of that, you know, on days when it is worth the air quality is worse. They are more affected than maybe, like I would be especially if they've had more severe cases. So it does like it definitely. It does affect them. And that's something that we always kind of have to keep an eye out for.
 
S: How do you feel? When your colleagues had health issue because of the air quality.
 
[Participant #41]: It's kind of like it's I mean, it's sad, and it's unfortunate, because it's just because of where we live and I don't know. I wish it wasn't that way, and I wish we didn't. You know they didn't have to pick between their health and their job.
But that ends up happening a lot.
 
S: Yeah, how comfortable are people in your workplace talking about air quality concerns.
 
[Participant #41]: I think because we have to talk about it. It. You know, we have to look at the Aqi for those projects, or if sometimes we'll just be there like, Oh, my lungs hurt today, and someone else be like mine, too, you know, like sometimes that there's like, was it hard to walk uphill today. Are we struggling? Am I tired like? What is it? And sometimes we'll come to just this, you know, consensus of like, I don't know. Maybe it's not just us. Maybe it's the air, and so I mean it. It feel like. In my field, maybe more than most, we might notice it.
 
S: Okay, I check Aqi quite frequently, maybe 10 or 15 times a day. But oftentimes I feel like there's there are some huge discrepancy between Aqi score and the and actually the thing that I'm experiencing right now. Ever felt something a similar experience like me.
 
[Participant #41]: I would say so like I would say the day I have a couple of examples, but I would say, like the day that we were out for. We call them blunt nose surveys, or the blunt nose leopard, lizard that lives around here. They're really cool looking, but we're out for those surveys when the fires were happening, and I had called, you know, the safety person at the office like, Hey, there's ash falling down from the sky. No one feels comfortable surveying, you know, all this stuff and they Oh, I'm sorry there was a bird, and I got very distracted.
Can you remind me what the question was?
 
S: Oh, so discrepancy between your own evaluation of air, quality and Aqi.
 
[Participant #41]: Yes, thank you. So you know, we were out, probably, I would say, like Bed Bell Ridge toward Lost Hills and the person in the office was looking at their Aqi. I'm assuming they were looking. I don't think they were looking at Bakersfield. I think they were looking at. Maybe whatever station, I don't know how Aqi is measured if it's the same as weather stations. But they were like, Oh, well, the Aqi is within a normal range. So you guys should survey. And I'm looking around and like, no, this is apocalyptic. No, we're not surveying. So I think there are discrepancies for sure. And then just I mean in my work, when we're actually working with construction crews and things like that.  it can. The dust can be insanely dense where we are very like, very specifically, that you know, one square mile location or whatever, and maybe not as bad wherever they're monitoring. Aqi. So I feel like that is an issue, and I don't again. I don't know how Aqi is measured or what weather stations are used for that. But, I've definitely found that it doesn't exactly reflect where I am.
 
S: Yeah, in that case, when you see such a, you know huge discrepancy. Do you try to follow your own evaluation of the air quality rather than the you know. Air Aqi score.
 
[Participant #41]: I mean, if possible, like in the fire scenario. Yeah, that you know the ash scenario. I was looking around like, I can't. You know I can believe my own eyes on this one other times I feel like, you know. Maybe we if it's just like Oh, I don't know it feels a little harder to breathe today, or maybe it's a little dusty, but the Aqi shows that it's fine. I think you kind of not gaslight yourself, but you know you kind of tell yourself. Oh, it's probably fine. You're just tired, or whatever cause there's it's showing you. It's you know it's good. You're good. Go ahead. What are you doing? So you're just kind of write it off as like, oh, maybe I'm just struggling today, for whatever reason. Yeah.
 
S: Have you ever felt, you know? You know, discomfort. When your manager or client wanted you to continue to work. even though your own evaluation of the air quality is not good.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, I mean, yeah. Cause I worked at a lot of jobs where I was very, very replaceable. And so a lot of people didn't speak up about their own comfort or safety for those reasons, or they were worried. They weren't gonna get the hours or pay, or whatever it is 
But I mean, luckily. And at this point in my career I was kind of able to turn it around on them a little bit and say, like, okay. So in this situation I would like you to tell me that it was safe enough for us to proceed with the survey when there's ash falling from the sky, and no one is comfortable surveying, and just kind of. because they won't say that they know it's unsafe, and they won't put that into words. They won't put that into writing. It's like either you agree with me or you don't, and if you disagree, tell me why you disagree with my call, and I will. Okay.
you know we'll go from there. But yeah, now that I'm in the position to leverage, you know. My! You know where I am in my career. It is nice to be able to kind of push back. But not a lot of people get to do that, and I've definitely been put put in situations where I didn't feel comfortable doing that either.
S: Have you ever shared your personal or family concerns or issues related to air quality with your colleagues?
 
[Participant #41]: What? My concerns sharing them with colleagues.
 
S: Yes, or your family members concerns about air quality issues like, you know, respiratory disease from my mom or dad. have you ever shared those kind of issue with your colleagues.
 
[Participant #41]: I don't have. Are you asking about, like respiratory issues that I inherited from my parents, or just their.
 
S: Just their difficulties. So, for example, I can just say to Dr. Lee that I went to hospital because of my mom's, you know, asthma.
I'm busy quite. I'm busy today. So in that way I can disclose that I have family concerns related to air quality.
 
[Participant #41]: Gotcha I think. I mean, my parents don't have very many issues with that that I'm aware of. But I think in our field like I said, a lot of people do have belly fever. A lot of people do have asthma. A lot of people do have. I mean, just even allergies. I guess that get triggered when the air is a little bit worse, and I think we all openly talk about that pretty often. So I mean, they definitely know the the friends that I have that have valley fever are their same friends, and we all know, like I said, like almost everyone has had belly fever at 1 point in my field. I think it's harder to find someone who hasn't. So it's something that when I had belly fever. I was talking about it, and they're like, Oh, I had that, too. Go to, you know. Talk to this, doctor, and do.
 
S: So it's quite normal to share how you guys can overcome air quality issues and symptoms.
 
[Participant #41]: Yes.
 
S: Okay. How about new employees? So they might. How do you pick new employees? Are they originally from, you know, Bakersfield? Or are there any new employees from other region where they don't know about belly fever?
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, we I mean, I've I've worked with both and usually in almost every work orientation I've been in. Even when I go onto a new project site or sign on with a new client. A lot of the safety orientations that we give include a segment about valley fever because it is endemic to this area, and it's something that can completely alter your life. And some, you know, some people can die from it. So it is something that we talk about quite often, and I think I'm not sure if they're legally bound to do it. But it's been in almost every safety orientation that I've done since I started in this field.
 
S: Okay, okay. I think that's a really good, you know. Training that. You know, general companies in Bakersfield does not do.
 
[Participant #41]: Because you don't have to do what I do to get valley fever. You can. What is it? It takes one spore, and that's it, and you go outside for a little bit, and on a dusty day, you know.
 
S: Yeah. When I came 1st came to Bakersfield I was actually preparing for La Martha. I just ran, ran, and I didn't know about the belly fever, but.
When I attended church, Deacon said, I need to worry about the valley fever, so don't walk outside when the bushes are, you know, moving around.
But actually, it needs, like almost 2 months in order to hear that information.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, yeah. And I think when I was younger, I thought of it as just like, Oh, that's something that like older people get, I guess, because I hadn't heard about it very often. And then, you know, I started working in this field, and it's very different. You know, anyone can get it so. And I think there's a lot more research coming out about it now. But yeah, they I've heard about it, for I mean, I've been in this field for about 10 plus years now so pretty often since then. But again, I think that's just my job. We're just kind of hyper aware of it because we have to be. And I think a lot of companies wanna ease themselves out of liability by warning you about it. So.
 
S: Actually, our research goal is not about improving. You know, air quality. Our research goal is to make people realize the sensitivity to the air quality issues are different across people. And because of that discrepancy on the sensitivity there could be some, you know, relationship, dissatisfaction between people, and they do not disclose their genuine concerns with others. So actually, so, I will have more questions around it. So sometimes people feel a sense of connection with each other's if they face common challenges like hurricane Katrina, that detrigged all the things around that city, and that makes some bond among the people. Now, I think you know air quality in Bakersfield that could have similar positive impact to the people in Bakersfield.
So when you learn that others share similar environmental concerns. how do you feel about that?
 
[Participant #41]: I. You know it feels nice to be around people who understand that it's a real issue. And you know, you're not just complaining about something that's not real. I think the 1st time I heard that, like one of the worst, you know, air quality is, the nation was in like the central valley. It was like, Oh, yeah, that makes sense. But also, you know, you feel validated a little bit.
 
S: Yeah. I. I believe that your colleagues in your organization might quite align with your perspective on air quality issue.
But how about others outside of your organization.
 
[Participant #41]: I feel like I feel like people will acknowledge that the air is bad.
but where the difference comes is like how to make it better. And that's when people start to get a little, you know, weird about it. But it's an ongoing joke, I think, is that the air quality has always been terrible here, so. I think that's some common ground.
 
S: Do you think that our community can improve air quality here.
 
[Participant #41]: I think I think you can. I think where I ha take issue with is that you know. I think everyone can make a difference, but I don't think it. And I think the biggest problem is, you know, the individual person. If that makes sense.
 
S: So what kind of you know, Attitude or motivation each individuals in Bakersfield need to have in order to improve air quality. Do you have any suggestion?
 
[Participant #41]: I think it's a lot of, you know. kind of educating yourself on who the biggest like polluters are, and then coming together as a community to like kind of push action forward and ask for that. I think that's hard for people to do. And then sometimes I guess people just don't have the time, or, or you know, aren't outside enough to really think about it.
And maybe they just don't think it's something that can change so I don't know, but I think that collective action is probably the most powerful thing that people can do.
 
S: As I said before, you know, sensitivity on air quality issues might quite different from others. So have you ever felt isolated, due to air quality issues or air health related to air, quality.
 
[Participant #41]: I personally haven't. But I know that you know some of my coworkers who have the more sensitivities to air quality have felt like they couldn't really confide in people, or that they.  we're gonna get fired from their job. If they couldn't do this work, or if they didn't feel comfortable doing the work.  so I think they can start to feel isolated because I mean some of their coworkers who just didn't understand or didn't care to understand, could just be like, well, I don't know why they don't just do the survey. I don't know why they don't just do it. I don't see the big deal, and so I think I think it can be pretty isolating.
 
S: Okay, quite interesting, even though in your organization, where people is quite knowledgeable about the air quality and also the negative impact of air quality. Even there. There are some variance in their sensitivity to the air. Quality issues.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah. And this is, you know, what I think the company I work with now has definitely been better about it. I think it's because it's a corporation. So they kind of have to be careful. But a lot of smaller companies, or just independent contractors don't feel that same pressure. And they.
Yeah, I don't know what it is. They understand that even if they've had valley fever, they know what it is hopefully, and they know what it's about, but they don't always have the. I guess I don't know if it's compassion or just, I don't know just oh, this person has something that makes them more sensitive to air quality, and they shouldn't put their body on the line to get work done, and they should maybe value their health more. So I think it's a lot of the old school thinking of like. yeah, it sucks, but do it. So I don't know. I feel like it's it's a little generational, but it can be just get it done. You know that kind of like thought.
 
S: Yeah, I I totally understand. I usually the old generation. They are struggle with with the hunger itself. They just wanted to survive. Now our new generation including me. Maybe we are not struggling for this survival. So so I think old generation have some kind of complaint over, you know, young generation.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, my, and my parents and I joke about that a lot where it's like, you know. My siblings and I all have stem degrees. And and we, you know, are in our jobs now, and we're happy. And we like our jobs and stuff. But we're still kind of like.
I don't care, fire me like I know what I'm worth, you know, like that kind of attitude, and and my parents are like I would never have ever felt that way. I was so scared to get fired all the time. And like, it's like, yeah. So was I, until I got to a certain level. And and you know, you just kind of like, I definitely paid my dues, and I worked really hard, and I got taken advantage of at work a lot, and did a lot of things that were very unsafe just to get it done, so that you know I could keep my job or get ahead or whatever. And at a certain point I was just like. Nope, so yeah, it is. We laugh about the generational difference, though.
 
S: Have you ever felt like you are the only one worried about the air quality while others seem unbothered? Can you just look over your past work experiences throughout the years.
Now I think you will have more autonomy as you became more experienced. But I'm just curious. When you're you are with a less tenure.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, I am. I'm sorry. Can you repeat the initial question? So I answer it correctly.
 
S: Have you ever felt like you're the only one worried about the air quality? Well, others seem unbothered, you know. Might not unbother with the air quality.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah. So a lot of the times it's, you know, like I said, the the even the safety person who worked in the office was a little bit less bothered by it than we were who were actually out in the field doing the work.
I've never felt like I was the only one. But you know a lot of people just felt uncomfortable speaking up about it.
 
S: Because it is related to their job stability.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, I think they might be seen. They are worried. Maybe that they might be seen as like difficult or you know and a lot of, at least one of the companies that I worked at when I was a younger biologist. If you were seen as difficult or just, you know. not eager to do the job, or go above and beyond, or work every weekend. Then they would pull you off of projects and reduce your hours. Yeah, okay, so you you did lose work. Yeah.
 
S: In that situation it might not be easy to reveal to other people that I'm concerned with the air quality, because I might be the one who could be affected.
 
H: I have a follow up question to that. Has that ever been so? Just to be straight straight. Has that ever been used by other people in a negative way? You know, kind of using that person's concern? Politically, I guess you can say. Has that ever have you seen that ever in your in your workplace.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, so not my current workplace, but in other workplaces. Yes, it was I was kind of in the middle of being a Normal Staff Level person, and the place was kind of clicky. So I was kind of like brought into like one of the favorites group and and starting to be a project manager. And so they were, including me in a lot of these conversations that were pretty uncomfortable of, you know. Oh, this person is worried about this. So like, let's just move them over here. I don't want to deal with that or so. I yeah, I've been in the room when those conversations happen, and feels a little retribution. He feels a little strange to me, but they got away with a lot of stuff.
 
H: I mean, as with any other normal person, you would feel really bad in that situation, right. And I think this has happened to some of our interviewees that interviewed recently that these, this information, this that you kind of exposed to other people has been used in a way. Yeah. not so much decide and not not benefit, not beneficial to the organization, I mean, or department. or relationships in general, right? But it happens right? I mean. I'm glad that it hasn't happened in your current organization yet. I mean, at least right.
 
[Participant #41]: Right? Yeah, and like, yeah, so that's I, that's another reason, why, I think you know especially in places like that where they don't know who they can come to, who they can talk to, who they can trust, with the information that it's not so much they don't feel that way. It's that they're afraid to say anything about it.
 
H: Lack of psychological safety in your workplace is.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah. And just as a kind of a fuller picture, a lot of people quit because of bullying. And you know, some people did try to push back and say they were fired wrongfully, and and you know, because they got sick because this thing happened to them, or whatever, and it never kind of went through.
But it's just that's the kind of workplace that where my mindset always is. So I think that's why I try to kind of step up for people when I can, because I was working in somewhere like that for a very long time. So yeah.
 
H: lucky to have you right and lucky to have someone in that position actually taking looking after I mean their employees right or their subordinates right? I mean. But in other places you don't see that as much right.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, unfortunately, yeah.
 
H: Well, thanks for sharing that. I mean, that's that's just something that does come up once in a while. That which is interesting. I mean to us.
 
S: So? Just curious. So if you were in the, you know workplace where you cannot disclose your vulnerability regarding air quality issues. how does that affect the relationship quality with the colleagues in in your team.
 
[Participant #41]: I think people kind of quickly identify who they can and cannot talk to. And you know, hopefully, somebody who is in that either middle position of power, whoever who hopefully they can trust at least one person there to bring up the issue. But a lot of times that doesn't happen. And you know people work in those places for as long as they can, and then they just try to go find somewhere else where?
Maybe they don't feel that way. So there's high turnover. So yeah.
 
S: So do you think that people you uses, the case whether they can, you know. share about their air quality issues freely with the people as an indicator that they can, you know, trust, trust the other. So do you think that that subject can be used as an indicator where they can, you know, trust their colleagues.
 
[Participant #41]: I think it can be, and I mean I I would see it as that if I you know, if I had sensitivities of the air quality, and I brought it up to a coworker. And they were like, Yeah, we'll deal with it. Then I'd be like, Okay, well, I'm not coming to you for anything anymore, because it's kind of a almost like benign basic health issue. and anything that's an actual health concern, like, for instance, my friend, who who, her ulcer will, you know, like start acting up the ulcer in her lungs will start acting up if the air quality is bad, or she's not taking care of herself.
If she brought that up to somebody and they didn't care. I, you know Red Flag feel like that's an easy like, oh, yeah, that's a concern. You should take care of yourself and let's figure out how to make this work. So I don't know for me. Yeah, I think that is, it's something that would tell you whether or not you could trust somebody and talk to them.
 
S: Okay, that's a really valuable point. I think we can use for our model.
So after this interview, we will, you know, analyze all the transcript from 43 interviews. You are 41 interview, and I think you're the one of the top interviewee who brought up a valuable point for us. So I really appreciate that. And
I have you seen the my you know, Linkedin posting about this, you know, Linkedin, posting about this interview research.
 
[Participant #41]: No, I haven't. I haven't been on Linkedin very much lately, but I definitely will now.
 
S: So I created this. I have post, shared the the URL with you, and I create this. You know the the female researcher.
 
S: With Charter, Pt. But I think it's quite similar to what you have showed to us. So so I was, quite, you know, quite interested to see the real person from this post
 
[Participant #41]: happy to help.
 
S: Okay, so we will do the daily survey during the fall semester, when there's a heavy wind, and whether the air quality is not bad. Are there any opportunity we could have survey your employees in your company? Do you think that your manager could? You know. would, you know, support our research.
 
[Participant #41]: I could definitely ask, yeah, I don't see why not.
 
S: Okay, basically, the subject is how people feel lonely when they kept you know, air quality issues by themselves, and how disclosing this vulnerability of the air quality could actually actually improve their work. Productivity.
 
[Participant #41]: Yeah, definitely. And I think, I could bring that up. We have an office safety like manager, and she's always talking about presentations and stuff like this, so I can bring it up to her as well.
 
S: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Yeah. I think I have to consume all my questions. Dr. Lee, do you have any question.
 
H: No, I think we've covered everything.
 
S: I hope you have a great day.
 
[Participant #41]: Great. I'm happy to help. Thank you.
