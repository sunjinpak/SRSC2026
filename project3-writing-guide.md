# Qualitative Paper Writing Guide

**For**: Tina & Cyrina
**Project**: Infertility Treatment and Workplace Support

This guide explains how to write a qualitative research paper based on Reddit data, using the structure from Grandey, Gabriel, & King (2020) "Tackling Taboo Topics" as a reference.

---

## Paper Structure Overview

Your paper should have the following sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Title** | Descriptive, includes key variables |
| **Abstract** | 150-250 words summarizing the entire paper |
| **Introduction** | Why this topic matters, what gap you're filling |
| **Method** | How you collected and analyzed data |
| **Results/Themes** | Your thematic findings with quotes |
| **Discussion** | What it means, implications, limitations |
| **References** | APA 7th edition format |

---

## 1. Title

Create a descriptive title that captures your research focus.

**Examples:**
- "Navigating Infertility Treatment While Working: A Qualitative Analysis of Reddit Posts"
- "Workplace Challenges During IVF Treatment: Themes from Online Communities"
- "Invisible Struggles: How Workers Manage Infertility Treatment and Employment"

---

## 2. Abstract

Write this LAST. Include:
- Purpose of the study (1-2 sentences)
- Method (data source, sample, analysis approach)
- Key findings (main themes)
- Implications (1-2 sentences)

**Example structure:**
> This study examined workplace challenges faced by individuals undergoing infertility treatment. Using qualitative content analysis of [N] Reddit posts from r/IVF, we identified [X] major themes: [list themes]. Findings suggest that [key implication]. Practical recommendations for HR policies are discussed.

---

## 3. Introduction

### Structure:
1. **Hook** (1 paragraph): Why should readers care about infertility treatment at work?
2. **Background** (2-3 paragraphs): What do we know about infertility and work?
3. **Gap** (1 paragraph): What's missing from current research?
4. **Purpose** (1-2 sentences): What does this study aim to do?

### Key Points to Address:
- Prevalence of infertility (affects ~15% of couples)
- IVF treatment demands (frequent appointments, physical/emotional toll)
- Work-life conflict challenges
- Lack of organizational support/policies
- Stigma and disclosure concerns
- Why Reddit data is valuable (anonymous, candid discussions)

### Sample Opening:
> Infertility affects approximately 15% of couples worldwide, yet workplace policies and practices rarely address the unique challenges faced by employees undergoing fertility treatments. Unlike other health conditions, infertility treatment requires frequent medical appointments, physical recovery time, and significant emotional labor, all while remaining largely invisible in organizational contexts.

---

## 4. Method

### 4.1 Data Source
Describe Reddit as your data source:
- r/IVF subreddit
- Why this source (anonymous, candid, rich qualitative data)
- Time period of posts collected (2024-2025)

### 4.2 Sample
- How many posts you analyzed
- Inclusion criteria (posts discussing work/workplace)
- Exclusion criteria (posts without work-related content)

### 4.3 Procedure
- How you searched for posts (keywords: work, job, boss, HR, employer, etc.)
- How you documented posts in Google Sheets
- How you checked for duplicates

### 4.4 Analysis
Describe thematic analysis:
> We employed thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's (2006) six-step approach: (1) familiarizing with the data, (2) generating initial codes, (3) searching for themes, (4) reviewing themes, (5) defining and naming themes, and (6) producing the report. Two researchers independently coded the data and met to discuss discrepancies until consensus was reached.

---

## 5. Results/Themes

This is the HEART of your paper. Present your themes with supporting quotes.

### How to Structure Themes

**Option A: Simple Theme Structure**
```
Theme 1: [Theme Name]
  - Explanation
  - Quote 1
  - Quote 2
  - Summary

Theme 2: [Theme Name]
  ...
```

**Option B: Table + Narrative (Recommended)**

Create a summary table like the Grandey et al. paper, then provide detailed narrative.

### Creating Your Thematic Table

Follow the format from Table 1 in the reference paper. Your table might include:

| Theme | Description | Example Quote | Frequency |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Time-related challenges | Difficulty scheduling appointments | "I had to lie about why I needed time off..." | 45 posts |
| Disclosure dilemmas | Deciding whether to tell employer | "I don't know if I should tell my boss..." | 38 posts |
| Lack of support | Absence of workplace policies | "My company has no fertility benefits..." | 32 posts |
| Emotional labor | Managing emotions at work | "I cried in the bathroom after..." | 28 posts |
| Financial stress | Cost of treatment affecting work | "I can't afford to quit but..." | 25 posts |

### Writing Theme Narratives

For each theme:

1. **Name the theme** (use descriptive labels)
2. **Define what it includes**
3. **Provide 2-3 representative quotes**
4. **Explain the significance**

**Example:**

> **Theme 1: Time-Related Challenges**
>
> The most prevalent theme across posts (n = 45) concerned the difficulty of managing frequent medical appointments while maintaining work responsibilities. IVF treatment requires numerous monitoring appointments, often with little advance notice, creating significant scheduling conflicts.
>
> One poster described the challenge:
> > "I have to go in for monitoring every morning at 7am for two weeks straight. My boss keeps asking why I'm late. I don't know what to tell her." (Post #24)
>
> Another highlighted the unpredictability:
> > "They called at 2pm saying I need to come in for retrieval tomorrow morning. I had three meetings scheduled." (Post #47)
>
> These time-related challenges were often compounded by the need to maintain secrecy about the treatment, forcing employees to create elaborate excuses for their absences.

### Quote Formatting

- Use block quotes for longer quotes (40+ words)
- Use quotation marks for shorter quotes
- Include post number for reference (e.g., Post #24)
- Remove any identifying information
- Keep quotes verbatim (including typos/informal language)

---

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Summary of Findings
- Briefly restate your main themes
- Connect to existing literature

### 6.2 Theoretical Implications
- How do your findings extend what we know?
- What theories help explain your findings?
  - Work-family conflict theory
  - Stigma and disclosure theory
  - Organizational support theory

### 6.3 Practical Implications / HR Recommendations

**This section is CRITICAL for your paper.**

Create a table of HR policy recommendations:

| Challenge | HR Policy Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Time for appointments | Flexible scheduling policies, telehealth support |
| Disclosure concerns | Confidential leave policies, trained HR staff |
| Lack of benefits | Fertility treatment coverage, EAP programs |
| Emotional support | Manager training, peer support groups |
| Financial burden | Fertility benefits, FSA/HSA options |

### 6.4 Limitations
Be honest about limitations:
- Reddit sample may not be representative
- Cannot verify information from anonymous posts
- Cultural/geographic limitations
- Self-selection bias (only those who post online)

### 6.5 Future Research
- Suggest what studies should come next
- Interview studies with employees
- Organizational-level studies
- Longitudinal studies tracking outcomes

## Writing Tips

### Do:
- Use clear, descriptive theme names
- Let quotes speak for themselves
- Be systematic in your analysis
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Make practical recommendations specific

### Don't:
- Over-interpret what posters meant
- Cherry-pick only dramatic quotes
- Make causal claims from qualitative data
- Generalize to all workers/organizations
- Include identifying information

### Voice and Tone:
- Academic but accessible
- Third person (avoid "I" or "we believe")
- Past tense for methods and results
- Present tense for discussing implications
