# Project 3: Infertility Treatment and Workplace Support

**Team**: Tina & Cyrina

**Title**: Workplace challenges faced by employees undergoing infertility treatment and HR policy recommendations

---

## Project Overview

Collect stories from Reddit about U.S. employees undergoing infertility treatment, analyze workplace challenges, and propose HR policies.

---

## Step 1: Use the Shared Google Sheet

**Google Sheet Link**: [Project 3 Data Collection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CFPfVthxXhWM2nncaMf-n7-8NzE5fSl6hL3B-SD1Mz0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

The Google Sheet already has data collected by previous students in February 2024. **Your task is to collect posts from the past year (2024-2025)** and add to the existing data.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Post ID | Reddit post/comment ID for reference |
| Subreddit | Source subreddit |
| Date | When posted |
| Quote/Summary | Key content (paraphrase, don't copy entire posts) |
| Workplace Challenge | Categorize the issue (e.g., leave policy, manager support, disclosure concerns) |
| Industry/Job Type | If mentioned |
| Notes | Your observations |

---

## Step 2: Primary Data Source - r/IVF

**Main Source**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/)

This is your primary subreddit for data collection. Focus your search here first.

### Search Keywords in r/IVF

Use the search bar within r/IVF and search for:
- "work"
- "job"
- "boss"
- "HR"
- "leave"
- "employer"
- "accommodations"
- "told my manager"
- "coworker"
- "remote work"

### Supplementary Subreddits (if needed)
- r/infertility
- r/tryingforababy
- r/AskHR

---

## Step 3: Data Collection Tips

### What to Look For

1. **Leave/Time Off Issues** - appointments, recovery time, unpredictable schedules
2. **Disclosure Dilemmas** - telling vs. not telling employer
3. **Manager/Coworker Reactions** - supportive or unsupportive responses
4. **Policy Gaps** - what employees wish their company offered
5. **Emotional/Mental Health** - stress of balancing treatment and work
6. **Financial Concerns** - insurance coverage, treatment costs affecting work decisions

### How to Record

- Paraphrase or summarize (don't copy entire posts verbatim)
- Note the context and emotional tone
- Flag particularly insightful posts for deeper analysis

---

## Step 4: Divide the Work

| Team Member | Responsibility |
|-------------|----------------|
| Tina | Search keywords A-L (e.g., "work", "job", "leave", "HR") |
| Cyrina | Search keywords M-Z (e.g., "manager", "remote", "coworker") |

### Avoiding Duplicates

- **Before adding a post**, search the Google Sheet by Reddit post title to check if it already exists
- If your teammate has already added a post, skip it

---

## Step 5: Coding and Analysis

### Codebook Reference

Review the existing codebook created by previous students:
[Codebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CFPfVthxXhWM2nncaMf-n7-8NzE5fSl6hL3B-SD1Mz0/edit?gid=243403948#gid=243403948)

After collecting data, you will abstract themes from the raw data. This means identifying patterns and categorizing what is happening in the stories.

### Reference Paper

See this paper for guidance on how to create a thematic table:
[Reference Paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_-Y6REpy_5eyPbj59kzkbCpDjDb6B67n&usp=drive_fs)

- **Refer to Table 1** for the format and structure

### What to Do with Themes

Once you identify themes, propose **HR policy recommendations** for how companies can create a more inclusive environment for women undergoing infertility treatment.

---

## Ethical Considerations

1. **Public Data Only** - Only use posts from public subreddits
2. **Anonymity** - Never include usernames in your final report
3. **Paraphrase** - Summarize rather than quote extensively
4. **No Direct Contact** - Do not message Reddit users
5. **Research Purpose** - This is for academic analysis only

---

## Project Timeline

1. **Data Collection** → Collect posts from r/IVF into Google Sheet
2. **Coding/Analysis** → Update codebook and create thematic table
3. **Paper Writing** → Write up findings and recommendations
4. **Presentation** → Create PPT and prepare for presentation
